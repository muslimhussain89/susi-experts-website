        The EB-2 National Interest Waiver (NIW) is a special provision under the
        second preference employment-based immigration category that allows
        eligible individuals to apply for permanent residency on their own,
        without needing a job offer or employer sponsorship. It is designed for
        those whose work holds significant merit and national importance, making
        the traditional labor market test unnecessary for the nation’s best
        interests. <br />
        <br />
        Normally, EB-2 petitions require a
        <strong> permanent, full-time job offer </strong> from a U.S. employer
        along with an approved labor certification from the Department of
        Labor—a lengthy process meant to prove that no qualified U.S. worker is
        available for the role. This requirement often creates a heavy burden
        for employers and restricts opportunities for foreign nationals without
        sponsorship. Consequently, many employers hesitate to sponsor EB-2
        candidates due to the cost and time involved in labor certification.{" "}
        <br />
        <br />
        Under the National Interest Waiver (NIW), individuals can ask USCIS to
        waive the usual job offer and labor certification requirements by
        showing that their work benefits the national interest of the United
        States. This allows for self-petitioning, meaning applicants can
        independently file Form I-140 and provide evidence of both EB-2
        eligibility and qualification for the waiver. <br />
        <br /> To qualify, petitioners must meet the EB-2 criteria{" "}
        <ul>
          <li>
            either as professionals with an advanced degree (or its equivalent)
          </li>{" "}
          <li>
            or as individuals with exceptional ability in the sciences, arts, or
            business.
          </li>
        </ul>{" "}
        After that, they must satisfy the three-prong test from the AAO’s
        landmark Matter of Dhanasar decision (2016), which evaluates the
        national importance of their work, their qualifications, and whether
        waiving the job offer and labor certification benefits the U.S.
        <br />
        <br /> On January 15, 2025, USCIS issued an important policy update
        further clarifying how EB-2 NIW petitions are assessed, refining key
        evaluation standards. The updated USCIS guidance clarifies several
        important aspects of NIW petitions, including:
        <ul>
          <li>How to define and clearly explain the proposed endeavor.</li>
          <li>
            How the petitioner’s qualifications relate to their proposed work.
          </li>
          <li>
            How both dependent and independent recommendation letters are
            evaluated.
          </li>
        </ul>
        The significance of endorsements from U.S. government and
        quasi-government entities. At North America Immigration Law Group, our
        extensive experience with thousands of NIW cases shows that the current
        framework is more transparent and accessible to professionals from
        diverse fields. By combining established legal precedent with clearer
        guidance, the EB-2 NIW continues to be a crucial pathway for individuals
        whose skills and contributions advance the national interest of the
        United States.

      <>
        A strong national interest argument alone isn’t enough to qualify for a
        National Interest Waiver (NIW). While the NIW removes the need for a job
        offer and labor certification, applicants must still meet the core EB-2
        requirements. <br />
        <br /> This means qualifying either as a professional with an advanced
        degree (or its equivalent) or as an individual with exceptional ability
        in the sciences, arts, or business. <br />
        <br /> Only after meeting the EB-2 criteria will USCIS evaluate whether
        granting the waiver serves the national interest.

    title: "What is 'National Interest' ?",
    content: (
      <>
        The term “national interest” is not strictly defined in law, but the
        Immigration Act of 1990 clarifies that a National Interest Waiver (NIW)
        under the EB-2 category must meet a standard “significantly above that
        necessary to prove prospective national benefit.” In other words, not
        every beneficial contribution qualifies—the petitioner must show that
        waiving the job offer and labor certification provides benefits of
        substantial magnitude to the nation.
        <br />
        <br />
        USCIS applies this standard flexibly, reviewing each case on its own
        merits, with the burden of proof on the petitioner to demonstrate a
        clear national benefit. Historically, USCIS has considered contributions
        that have a direct and tangible impact on national priorities, such as:
        <ul>
          <li>Advancing the U.S. economy.</li>
          <li>Improving wages or working conditions for U.S. workers.</li>
          <li>
            Supporting affordable housing initiatives for vulnerable groups.
          </li>
          <li>
            Enhancing the environment or promoting efficient use of natural
            resources.
          </li>
          <li>
            Contributions specifically requested or endorsed by U.S. government
            agencies.
          </li>
        </ul>
        Beyond economic or scientific impact, USCIS may also weigh cultural,
        public welfare, and national security benefits, provided there’s a clear
        link between the petitioner’s work and the claimed benefit. At North
        America Immigration Law Group, our extensive experience shows that USCIS
        recognizes a wide range of professions and endeavors as meeting the NIW
        standard—what matters most is demonstrating that your specific work has
        substantial merit, national relevance, and meaningful societal impact.

      "Matter of Dhanasar: The Current Standard for National Interest Waivers",
    content: (
      <>
        On December 27, 2016 , the Administrative Appeals Office (AAO) issued
        the landmark decision in Matter of Dhanasar , which set the current
        standard for evaluating EB-2 National Interest Waiver (NIW) petitions.
        <br />
        <br />
        This ruling introduced a more flexible and modern framework for
        determining when a waiver of the job offer and labor certification
        requirements is justified. Under the Dhanasar test , a petitioner must
        show that:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            The proposed endeavor has substantial merit and national importance.
          </li>
          <li>
            The petitioner is well-positioned to advance the proposed endeavor.
          </li>
          <li>
            On balance, waiving the job offer and labor certification benefits
            the United States.
          </li>
          <li>
            This three-prong test now forms the foundation of all EB-2 NIW
            adjudications.

      "How to Meet the Requirements for a National Interest Waiver Based on Matter of Dhanasar",
    content: (
      <>
        <br />
        <strong>1. Substantial Merit and National Importance</strong> <br />
        <br />
        To meet the first prong of the Matter of Dhanasar framework, the
        petitioner must show that the proposed endeavor carries both substantial
        merit and national importance. As clarified in the January 2025 USCIS
        policy update, these are separate concepts but are evaluated together to
        determine the broader significance of the work. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>1.1 Substantial merit</strong> <br />
        <br /> can be demonstrated across diverse fields such as science,
        technology, healthcare, education, business, public policy, and the
        arts. The endeavor does not need to provide immediate economic gains;
        instead, it should address an important issue, advance knowledge or
        practices in its field, or improve societal well-being.
        <br /> <br /> Supporting evidence may include:
        <br /> <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            A clear and well-structured description of the proposed endeavor,
            detailing its goals, scope, and relevance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Research publications, technical reports, or documentation that
            substantiate its merit.
          </li>
          <li>
            Recommendation letters explaining the value and impact of the work
            in accessible terms.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <strong>1.2: National Importance</strong> <br />
        <br />
        The national importance aspect looks at the impact of the proposed
        endeavor beyond a purely local or individual level. According to the
        2025 USCIS policy update , there is now greater emphasis on how clearly
        the petitioner defines their endeavor and whether it aligns with U.S.
        government priorities or addresses significant, publicly recognized
        challenges.
        <br />
        <br />
        Key factors USCIS considers include:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Whether the endeavor has national or global significance within its
            field.
          </li>
          <li>
            Whether it supports U.S. government initiatives or national
            priorities (e.g., public health, energy sustainability, AI
            innovation, climate resilience).
          </li>
          <li>
            Whether it contributes to economic growth, equity, public safety, or
            the advancement of knowledge
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        Examples of persuasive evidence may include:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Federal or state funding (e.g., NIH, NSF, DOE, DOD) for projects
            related to the petitioner’s work.
          </li>
          <li>
            Documentation or endorsements showing the endeavor’s alignment with
            national strategies or priority areas.
          </li>
          <li>
            Recognition from relevant organizations or agencies highlighting its
            broader societal impact.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <strong>
          2. Well Positioned to Advance the Proposed Endeavor
        </strong>{" "}
        <br />
        <br />
        The second prong of the Dhanasar framework requires petitioners to show
        they are well positioned to carry out their proposed endeavor . USCIS
        looks for evidence that the petitioner has the qualifications,
        expertise, and proven track record necessary to successfully advance the
        work.
        <br />
        <br />
        Factors USCIS considers include:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Academic degrees and professional training relevant to the endeavor.
          </li>
          <li>Specialized skills, certifications, or technical expertise.</li>
          <li>
            Documented prior achievements such as publications, patents,
            projects, or awards.
          </li>
          <li>
            Demonstrated progress toward the endeavor’s goals (e.g., early
            results, collaborations, product development).
          </li>
          <li>
            {" "}
            Recognition, support, or investment from third parties like
            institutions, investors, or government agencies.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        Supporting evidence may include: <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Detailed recommendation letters that specifically address the
            petitioner’s expertise and contributions.
          </li>
          <li>Records of key roles in funded or government-backed projects.</li>
          <li>
            Memberships, awards, or honors that recognize professional
            excellence.
          </li>
          <li>
            Media coverage or invited talks highlighting impact in the field.
          </li>
          <li>
            Proof of commercialization, licensing, or adoption of the
            petitioner’s work by others.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        While absolute certainty of success is not required, USCIS places
        significant weight on credible, detailed, and corroborated evidence .
        Vague or unsupported statements will not suffice; specificity and
        documentation are essential.
        <br />
        <br />
        At our firm, we leverage evidentiary strategies often used in EB-1A and
        EB-2 Exceptional Ability cases to strengthen NIW petitions, tailoring
        each filing to highlight unique strengths.
        <br />
        <br /> Common persuasive evidence includes: <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Publications & citation records: Showing influence and recognition
            in the field.
          </li>
          <li>
            Recommendation letters: From experts with direct knowledge of
            achievements and impact.
          </li>
          <li>
            Government grants: Participation in federally funded research or
            projects.
          </li>
          <li>
            Selective memberships: In organizations that require notable
            accomplishments.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prestigious awards: Nationally or internationally recognized honors.
          </li>
          <li>
            Published material about the petitioner: Media or scholarly articles
            validating contributions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Patents, contracts, or licenses: Proof of practical applications and
            value.
          </li>
          <li>
            External reliance: Documentation of others depending on the
            petitioner’s expertise.
          </li>
          <li>
            Critical roles: Evidence of leadership or indispensable
            contributions in high-value projects.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <strong>
          3. Balancing Test: Demonstrating Why Waiving the Job Offer and Labor
          Certification Serves the U.S. National Interest
        </strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        The third prong of the <b>Matter of Dhanasar</b> framework involves a{" "}
        <b>balancing analysis</b>—assessing whether, overall, it would benefit
        the United States to
        <b>waive the job offer and labor certification requirements</b>. This
        evaluation weighs the petitioner’s anticipated contributions to the
        national interest against the policy goal of the labor certification
        process, which is designed to protect U.S. workers and the labor market.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Relevant factors USCIS may take into account include:</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            The petitioner possesses rare or highly specialized expertise,
            making the labor certification process impractical or unlikely to
            succeed.
          </li>
          <li>
            The proposed work is time-sensitive or urgent and could be
            significantly delayed by labor certification procedures.
          </li>
          <li>
            The petitioner’s self-employment is structured in a way that does
            not negatively affect U.S. workers.
          </li>
          <li>
            The endeavor is anticipated to generate jobs, drive economic growth,
            or strengthen U.S. competitiveness .
          </li>
          <li>
            Even if qualified U.S. workers exist, the petitioner’s contributions
            provide a level of benefit that surpasses what labor market testing
            seeks to protect.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        Importantly, USCIS does not require proof that labor certification is
        impossible—only that waiving it produces greater overall benefits. This
        prong is especially advantageous for entrepreneurs, independent
        researchers, and public-interest innovators whose work is not tied to
        one employer or a narrowly defined job role.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Types of evidence that can help meet this requirement include:</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            A detailed statement or legal brief explaining why the labor
            certification process is not well-suited to the petitioner’s
            specific endeavor.
          </li>
          <li>
            Proof that securing a traditional job offer is not feasible or that
            standard employment arrangements would impede the petitioner’s
            contributions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Letters of support or endorsements from agencies, institutions, or
            collaborators emphasizing the urgency and national value of the
            work.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        The petitioner’s argument should focus on showing that{" "}
        <b>
          the advantages of permitting their contributions to move forward
          without delay or restriction outweigh the benefits of traditional
          labor market safeguards
        </b>
        . When the first two prongs are solidly established, the third prong is
        typically supported through a cohesive and well-substantiated case
        presentation.

        <br />
        <br /> Officers now evaluate whether the applicant’s occupation
        qualifies as a “profession” under INA 101(a)(32) and if a bachelor’s
        degree plus five years of progressive experience fulfills the
        requirements of that profession.

        Essential components of a <b>well-articulated endeavor</b> include:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Specific Goals and Scope</b> – Clearly outline what the

            anticipated outcomes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Execution Plan</b> – Specify whether the endeavor will be carried
            out through employment with an organization, independently, or via
            entrepreneurial or self-directed research activities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>National Relevance</b> – Explain how the endeavor aligns with
            larger U.S. priorities, such as economic growth, public health,
            environmental sustainability, national security, or advancements in
            science and technology.
          </li>
        </ol>
        USCIS evaluates the endeavor’s impact based on its{" "}
        <b>
          expected influence within the field and its alignment with national
          objectives

        , rather than limiting consideration to local or employer-specific
        benefits. A persuasive statement detailing <i>what</i> the petitioner
        will do, <i>how</i> they will do it, and <i>why</i> it matters on a
        national scale has become central to petition approval.

        <b>3. Updated Expectations for Recommendation Letters</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The <b>2025 USCIS policy update</b> emphasizes that the strength of a
        recommendation letter is determined by its content rather than the
        independence of the writer. USCIS now prioritizes letters from
        individuals with <b>direct knowledge</b> of the petitioner’s work—such
        as supervisors, collaborators, or project leaders.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>What Defines a Strong Letter?</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        For a National Interest Waiver petition, an effective recommendation
        letter should:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>
            Highlight the petitioner’s <b>specific accomplishments</b>,

          <li>
            Show how the petitioner is <b>well positioned</b> to advance their
            proposed endeavor based on experience, skills, and demonstrated
            success;
          </li>
          <li>
            Explain the <b>national significance</b> of the petitioner’s work,
            referencing its contributions to public policy, science, economic
            development, or other U.S. priorities;

        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>
            Letters offering <b>specific, detailed examples</b> rather than
            generic praise;

        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          Generic, vague, or repetitive letters can weaken a petition.
          Statements like “widely respected in the field” without supporting
          details or context add little value and may fail to persuade
          adjudicators.

// ************************ Requirements For Petitioning For the National Interest Waiver (NIW)  **********************************************
// **************************************************************************************************

export const nivRequirements = [
  <>
    There are several factors to keep in mind when determining if pursuing a
    petition under this category is appropriate for you. While every case is
    unique and should be evaluated by qualified immigration attorneys, the
    following general considerations may help assess whether the National
    Interest Waiver (NIW) could be a suitable option.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>EB-2 Eligibility Is Required</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    It is important to understand that meeting the NIW criteria does not itself
    establish EB-2 eligibility. Rather, the NIW only waives the job offer and
    labor certification requirements otherwise associated with EB-2. Before
    considering an NIW petition, the applicant must first confirm that they
    qualify for EB-2 classification.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>EB-2 Requirements: Advanced Degree or Exceptional Ability</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    To qualify for EB-2 status, the petitioner must either: 1) hold an advanced
    degree, or 2) demonstrate exceptional ability in their field.
    <br />
    <br />
    Most applicants meet EB-2 qualifications through an advanced degree. This
    can be shown in two primary ways: (1) holding a U.S. academic or
    professional degree above the baccalaureate level, or a foreign equivalent
    degree evaluated as comparable; or (2) possessing a U.S. bachelor’s degree
    (or its foreign equivalent) <span>plus</span> at least five years of
    progressive, post-baccalaureate professional experience. USCIS treats the
    combination of a bachelor’s degree and five years of qualifying experience
    as equivalent to a U.S. master’s degree.
    <br />
    <br />
    Alternatively, applicants without an advanced degree may establish EB-2
    eligibility by showing exceptional ability in their field—meaning a level of
    expertise significantly above what is typically encountered in their
    profession.
    <br />
    <br />
    After meeting these minimum EB-2 criteria, a job offer and a labor
    certification from the Department of Labor (DOL) are normally required.
    Outside the NIW context, this means the employer must file on behalf of the
    beneficiary; self-petitioning is not permitted. Due to these added
    requirements, many applicants consider the NIW route, which allows qualified
    individuals to self-petition without the need for a job offer or labor
    certification.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>
      NIW Standard Under the AAO Decision – Matter of Dhanasar (December 27,
      2016)
    </strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    Once basic EB-2 eligibility is established, the applicant must also
    demonstrate that they qualify for the NIW in order to bypass the job offer
    and labor certification requirements, or to self-petition.
    <br />
    <br />
    Previously, USCIS applied the three-part test from{" "}
    <i>New York State Dept. of Transportation</i>, 22 I&amp;N Dec. 215 (Comm.
    1998) (“NYSDOT”), which required showing:
    <br />
    <br />
    <ol>
      <li>The work had “substantial intrinsic merit”;</li>
      <li>The benefits of the proposed employment were “national in scope”;</li>
      <li>
        The petitioner served the “national interest to a substantially greater
        degree” than an otherwise qualified U.S. worker, such that requiring a
        labor certification would harm the national interest.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    However, on December 27, 2016, the Administrative Appeals Office (AAO)
    issued a decision in <i>Matter of Dhanasar</i>, replacing the NYSDOT test
    with a new analytical framework. Under <i>Dhanasar</i>, USCIS may grant a
    National Interest Waiver if the applicant establishes the following three
    criteria:
    <br />
    <br />
    <ol>
      <li>
        The proposed endeavor has both substantial merit and national
        importance;
      </li>
      <li>
        The petitioner is well positioned to advance the proposed endeavor;
      </li>
      <li>
        On balance, it would benefit the United States to waive the job offer
        and labor certification requirements.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    <strong>1. Substantial Merit and National Importance </strong> <br /> <br />
    To meet the first prong under <i>Matter of Dhanasar</i>, the petitioner must
    show that their proposed endeavor has both substantial merit and national
    importance. This requires demonstrating that the work is tied to a
    significant national goal and benefits the United States. The endeavor’s
    merit can arise in various fields, such as business, entrepreneurship,
    science, technology, culture, health, or education.
    <br /> <br />
    USCIS evaluates national importance based on the endeavor’s potential
    prospective impact, considering its broader implications beyond a specific
    geographic region. For example, a physician working in a single hospital may
    appear to benefit only the local area, but if their research is published
    nationally or their techniques are adopted in hospitals across the U.S.,
    their work can be deemed nationally important.
    <br /> <br />
    Scientific research often naturally aligns with national interests, such as
    public health or safety. However, many other fields may also meet this
    criterion when their contributions have wider societal value. Below are
    examples of endeavors that have been found to possess substantial merit and
    national importance:
    <br /> <br />
    <ul>
      <li>
        A postdoctoral researcher in medicinal chemistry developing anti-viral
        and anti-cancer drugs impacting U.S. healthcare.
      </li>
      <li>
        A civil engineer improving asphalt durability, enhancing transportation
        infrastructure and safety.
      </li>
      <li>
        A petroleum engineering consultant increasing energy efficiency and
        advancing environmentally sustainable practices.
      </li>
      <li>
        An opera singer contributing to cultural enrichment and vocal health
        knowledge.
      </li>
      <li>An animator advancing American art and design.</li>
      <li>
        A gastroenterology physician improving diagnostic and treatment methods
        nationwide.
      </li>
      <li>An entrepreneur boosting economic growth and job creation.</li>
      <li>
        An economics researcher contributing to risk management and U.S.
        economic stability.
      </li>
      <li>
        An oncology researcher advancing cancer therapy development impacting
        healthcare nationally.
      </li>
      <li>
        A physician developing diagnostic practices implemented across the U.S.
      </li>
      <li>
        A postdoctoral electrochemistry researcher improving battery performance
        with nationwide applications.
      </li>
      <li>
        A musician contributing to national arts and culture through
        performances and distribution of work.
      </li>
      <li>
        A geologist studying mineral-water reactions to improve U.S. water
        safety.
      </li>
      <li>A web developer producing content and platforms used nationwide.</li>
    </ul>{" "}
    <br />
    <strong>2. Advancing the Proposed Endeavor </strong>
    <br /> <br />
    The second prong focuses on whether the petitioner is well positioned to
    advance the proposed endeavor. USCIS considers factors such as:
    <br /> <br />
    <ul>
      <li>The individual’s education, skills, and specialized knowledge.</li>
      <li>A track record of success in similar or related efforts.</li>
      <li>A clear plan or model for future activities.</li>
      <li>Evidence of progress already made towards the endeavor.</li>
      <li>
        Interest from potential customers, collaborators, investors, or relevant
        institutions.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    Supporting evidence may include detailed expert letters referencing U.S.
    government interest in the petitioner’s work, documentation of involvement
    in government-funded projects, and records of academic credentials,
    professional achievements, memberships, and media coverage relevant to the
    field.
    <br /> <br />
    <strong>
      3. Balancing Test: National Interest vs. Job Offer Requirement{" "}
    </strong>
    <br /> <br />
    The third prong requires showing that, on balance, it benefits the United
    States to waive the job offer and labor certification requirements. USCIS
    may consider whether:
    <br /> <br />
    <ul>
      <li>
        Due to the petitioner’s qualifications or the nature of the endeavor,
        obtaining a job offer or labor certification would be impractical.
      </li>
      <li>
        The U.S. would gain from the petitioner’s contributions even if
        qualified U.S. workers are available.
      </li>
      <li>
        The petitioner’s contributions are of such urgency or importance that
        bypassing the labor certification process is justified.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    Meeting all three prongs strengthens the case for an NIW approval, allowing
    qualified individuals to self-petition and bypass the employer sponsorship
    and labor certification process.
    <br /> <br />
    <p>
      This provision is particularly advantageous for entrepreneurs who have a
      proven track record of contributing to the United States through their
      business endeavors and who are reasonably expected to continue making
      similar contributions in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our firm specializes in crafting compelling arguments to address each
      requirement of this prong and assembling robust supporting documentation
      for every claim presented. When gathering evidence for the third prong, it
      is helpful to review the criteria for EB-1A (Alien of Extraordinary
      Ability) and EB-2 Exceptional Ability. While EB-1A carries a higher legal
      standard and stricter evidentiary thresholds, its criteria can guide the
      types of documentation that effectively demonstrate the applicant’s record
      of achievement and the significance of their proposed work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below is an overview of commonly included evidence in EB-2 NIW (National
      Interest Waiver) petitions, along with explanations for how each type of
      documentation can address NIW requirements:
    </p>
    <br /> <br />
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Publications &amp; Citation Records</b>
        <br />
        Include a complete list of publications (journal articles, book
        chapters, books) to highlight the petitioner’s contributions. However,
        publication alone does not establish influence; citation records are
        important to show how the work has been adopted by other researchers.
        Supporting details such as journal impact factors and field-specific
        citation averages can further demonstrate above-average influence. There
        is no specific citation count required for NIW approval, and various
        strategies can be used to offset a low citation record.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>
        <b>Letters of Recommendation</b>
        <br />
        Strong recommendation letters are critical to any NIW case. Independent
        letters (from individuals who have not directly worked with or advised
        the petitioner) carry greater weight with USCIS compared to dependent
        letters. These letters should explain the petitioner’s work and its
        importance in accessible terms and directly comment on its benefit to
        the U.S. Ideally, they should also include examples of how the
        petitioner’s work has been applied. As part of our service, we draft
        tailored recommendation letters, help select the most effective
        recommenders, and ensure each letter includes the necessary elements to
        support the petition.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>
        <b>Government Funding/Grants</b>
        <br />
        Grants or funding from respected organizations or government agencies
        (e.g., NIH, NASA, U.S. Military) are persuasive evidence of the national
        significance of the petitioner’s work. It is crucial to detail the
        petitioner’s active role in securing and contributing to the funded
        projects.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>
        <b>Membership</b>
        <br />
        Membership in organizations within the petitioner’s field can strengthen
        credentials, particularly if they require outstanding accomplishments as
        part of the selection process.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>
        <b>Awards</b>
        <br />
        Nationally or internationally recognized awards can significantly
        enhance an NIW petition. Ideally, these awards should be individually
        granted rather than limited to a specific institution or region. For
        example, an award from the American Chemical Society would likely carry
        significant national recognition.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>
        <b>Published Material About the Petitioner</b>
        <br />
        Media coverage focused on the petitioner and their work, especially when
        featured in nationally or internationally recognized outlets, can help
        demonstrate the broader impact and benefit of their contributions.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>
        <b>Patents, Contracts, Licenses, and Technology Transfers</b>
        <br />A record of patents, along with evidence of citation or
        commercialization, is powerful proof that the petitioner’s work has
        practical applications and has been adopted in the industry. Other
        similar evidence such as contracts, licenses, or technology transfers
        also demonstrates implementation of the petitioner’s contributions.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>
        <b>Evidence of Others Relying on the Petitioner’s Work</b>
        <br />
        Requests for collaboration or assistance from external researchers, or
        acknowledgments in major industry publications or media, can help show
        the petitioner’s influence and the significance of their work.
      </li>
      <br />
    </ol>
    <p>
      Ultimately, presenting a diverse and cohesive set of evidence is essential
      to demonstrate that the petitioner qualifies for a National Interest
      Waiver. It is not enough to simply list achievements; the petition should
      integrate all components — including recommendation letters and supporting
      evidence — into a unified argument that clearly satisfies each element of
      the three-prong test. At North America Immigration Law Group, our approach
      ensures that every aspect of your NIW petition addresses the necessary
      legal requirements effectively.

    <strong>Approval or Refund</strong>
    <br /> <br />
    We back our work with a clear promise: if your case is not approved, you
    receive a full refund of our attorney’s fee. Few law firms offer a
    comparable commitment. Drawing on proven NIW strategies, we approach every
    petition with complete confidence in the result.
    <br /> <br />
    <strong>Winning Strategies — From Start to Approval</strong>
    <br /> <br />
    From day one, our focus is your approval. After studying thousands of cases
    and relevant decisions, we’ve developed NIW strategies that present your
    qualifications clearly, convincingly, and decisively. While adjudication
    rests with USCIS, as an administrative agency it must apply standards
    consistently—our filings are crafted to align with those standards and
    prevailing policy.
    <br /> <br />
    <strong>Top Law School–Educated Attorneys</strong>
    <br /> <br />
    We staff only Juris Doctor–credentialed attorneys from leading law schools.
    Our team is fluent in the law, USCIS regulations, and case precedent—and
    continually monitors the latest trends and changes. Because immigration
    rules evolve, you need diligent, highly trained counsel to guide your
    petition.
    <br /> <br />
    <strong>Legal Fee</strong>
    <br /> <br />
    Even with comprehensive services—including drafting every USCIS submission
    and, for eligible cases, our approval-or-refund guarantee—our legal fees
    remain competitive and reasonable.
    <br /> <br />
    We were the first immigration firm to offer a refund policy on I-140
    petitions, set out explicitly in the
    <a href="#">attorney–client agreement</a>
    and binding on our firm. Qualified clients may also opt for flexible,
    multi-installment payment plans.
    <br /> <br />
    <strong>What are the payment methods?</strong>
    <br /> <br />
    We accept cash, personal checks, money orders, traveler’s checks, cashier’s
    checks, wire transfers, and online payments via MasterCard and Visa.
    <br /> <br />
    <strong>What does the legal fee include?</strong>
    <br /> <br />
    <ol>
      <li>
        <span>Unlimited Inquiries for the Petition</span>: Once you sign the
        retainer and submit payment, the attorney–client relationship begins and
        continues until the case closes. We will prepare your case promptly,
        thoroughly, and professionally. Our commitment includes:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Strict adherence to the timelines in your contract—your petition
            will not be delayed on our side.
          </li>
          <li>
            Timely responses to your questions—most I-140 preparation inquiries
            are answered within 24 business hours.
          </li>
          <li>
            Availability for scheduled phone consultations with 24 hours’
            notice.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>
        <span>Discussing Potential Recommenders</span>: We review your proposed
        reference list and advise on the strongest candidates for recommendation
        letters.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span>Drafting the Recommendation Letters</span>: Unlike firms that rely
        on templates or charge extra, we draft your recommendation letters.
        Effective letters require deep NIW experience and a nuanced
        understanding of USCIS preferences—well-crafted letters are essential to
        success.
      </li>

      <li>
        Drafting the Petition Letter: We analyze your credentials within our
        proven petition framework and prepare a tailored, strategy-driven
        filing. You will receive the first draft within 10 business days after
        we receive all signed recommendation letters. We will revise the
        petition letter until you are satisfied.
      </li>

      <li>
        Preparing and Filing the Petition Package : After receiving all
        evidence, we prepare exhibits and organize your materials to meet USCIS
        regulations and preferences.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span>
          Responding to RFE (Request for Evidence) or NOID (Notice of Intent to
          Deny) at No Extra Charge
        </span>
        : If USCIS issues an RFE or NOID, we notify you immediately and
        implement a response strategy to secure approval—this may include
        additional recommendation/testimonial letters or a Citation Impact
        Analysis Report. We respond promptly and never miss deadlines.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span>If Denied: Your Choice of Full Refund or Free Re-filing</span>:
        With our approval-or-refund service, if your petition is denied you may
        choose an immediate full refund or a free re-filing. If a re-filed case
        is also denied, our refund policy still applies and we return your
        attorney’s fee.
      </li>

        <br /> <br />
        Once you notify us of your decision to retain our services, we will
        email you a Retainer Agreement tailored to the service package you
        selected. Please review it carefully and reach out to us with any
        questions regarding the terms, services, or payment details.

        checks, money orders, traveler’s checks, cashier’s checks, wire
        transfers, as well as MasterCard and Visa credit cards (online payment

        <br /> <br />
        After we countersign the Retainer Agreement, we will email you a scanned
        copy. At this point, the attorney–client relationship is officially
        established. From then on, we will prepare your case diligently and
        professionally. As your legal counsel, we will:

        receive a client packet via email. This packet provides detailed
        guidance on our process and how we will work together to achieve your
        goals. It includes:

            A detailed questionnaire about your credentials and supporting

        <strong>1. Completing the Questionnaire</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        After receiving your client packet, you will need to carefully complete
        the questionnaire, providing all requested details and supporting
        information.

          <li>
            <span>Identifying Potential Recommenders</span>: Once we review your
            completed questionnaire, we will work with you to identify suitable
            recommenders. Please review the client packet section on
            recommendation letters before this discussion. While there is no
            strict USCIS requirement for the number of letters, 3 to 7 is
            generally considered appropriate.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span>Contacting Recommenders</span>: After finalizing your list,
            you may reach out to your recommenders. We provide sample request
            emails and suggested talking points. Since many recommenders are
            busy professionals, you may let them know that draft letters will be
            prepared for their review and approval.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span>Drafting Recommendation Letters</span>: If your recommenders
            prefer you to provide draft letters (which is common), we will
            prepare them for you. To ensure accuracy, you will need to provide
            us with details about each recommender’s expertise, reputation, and
            connection to your work.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span>Finalizing Recommendation Letters</span>: We will create
            initial drafts and send them to you for feedback. After
            incorporating your revisions, you will forward the finalized drafts
            to your recommenders for their approval and signature. If
            recommenders request changes, we will assist with revisions as
            needed.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <strong>3. Preparing Supporting Documentation</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        While working on recommendation letters, you should also begin gathering
        additional supporting documents, which may include:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>
            Official academic records, diplomas, certificates, or licenses.
          </li>
          <li>
            Letters from past or current employers describing your work and
            contributions.
          </li>
          <li>Evidence of national or international awards.</li>
          <li>Proof of membership in prestigious professional associations.</li>
          <li>
            Published materials about you in reputable publications or
            newspapers (with certified English translations, if needed).
          </li>
          <li>Evidence of judging others’ work (e.g., invitation letters).</li>
          <li>
            Documentation of significant contributions to your field (e.g.,
            expert testimonials).
          </li>
          <li>
            Authorship of scholarly publications (e.g., journal articles, book
            chapters).
          </li>
          <li>
            Evidence of high salary compared to others in your field (e.g.,
            payroll records, employer affidavits).
          </li>
          <li>
            Proof of critical roles held in organizations with strong
            reputations (e.g., employer affidavits).
          </li>
        </ol>

          Fee
        </strong>

        <br />
        Once all recommendation letters and supporting documents are finalized,
        please send them to us along with the I-140 filing fee.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>5. Drafting the Petition Letter</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        After receiving your complete documentation, we will carefully evaluate
        your credentials and prepare a petition letter with strong legal
        arguments based on our proven strategies. You will receive a draft
        within approximately two weeks for review and feedback. We will revise
        the petition letter until you are fully satisfied.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>6. Preparing Form I-140 and Submitting the Petition</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        We will complete Form I-140, prepare the exhibit list, and organize all
        supporting documents according to USCIS requirements. The completed
        package, including the petition letter, will be sent to you for review
        and signature. After a final check, we will submit the petition package
        to USCIS via FedEx.

        <br />
        After submitting your package, we will scan and email you a copy of the
        USCIS official receipt once available, usually within 2 weeks. Using the
        case number, you can track your case status online on the USCIS website.
        At the same time, we will also monitor your case progress on your
        behalf.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>2. Approval</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        As soon as we receive the approval notice from USCIS, we will notify you
        immediately. The original approval notice will be mailed to you
        promptly. Once approved, your case is considered closed. At this stage,
        we will also email you instructions for filing Form I-485 or assist you
        with preparing the I-485 at a discounted legal fee.

        <strong>3. Request for Evidence (RFE)</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        If USCIS issues an RFE, we will inform you right away and provide
        guidance on preparing additional documents in response. We will draft
        reference letters and legal arguments to address the RFE and submit the
        response on your behalf at no extra cost. If your case is approved after
        responding to the RFE, the process will continue as outlined in the
        approval step above.

        <ol>
          <li>
            <span>Officer’s discretion</span>: Despite our dedicated
            representation, final approval of the I-140 rests with the
            adjudicating officer, and occasional erroneous denials may occur.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Understanding the reasons for denial</span>: If your petition
            is denied, we will notify you immediately, explain the USCIS
            reasoning, and advise you on possible next steps, including an
            appeal.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Refund or appeal</span>: You may choose to receive a full
            refund right away or proceed with an appeal, which we will handle at
            no additional cost. If the appeal succeeds, the process will follow
            the same steps as an approval.

        </ol>
        <br />
        We are fully confident in our ability to represent our clients
        successfully. In fact, we are the only U.S. immigration law firm
        offering a refund policy on I-140 petitions. This is not just a

    Our clients come from diverse backgrounds and regions around the world, and
    petitioning under the National Interest Waiver (NIW) category can offer many
    advantages depending on an individual’s nationality, occupation, and
    research. These advantages generally fall into three groups:
    <br />
    a) general benefits, <br />
    b) nationality-based benefits, and <br />
    c) occupation or research-specific benefits.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>
      General Benefits of Petitioning Under the National Interest Waiver (NIW)
    </strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    Each case is unique and requires a careful legal evaluation, but overall,
    the NIW provides professionals with advanced degrees a pathway that is often
    less demanding than the EB-1A category. For example, a researcher with fewer
    than 100 citations may find it easier to obtain NIW approval compared to
    EB-1A. Additionally, unlike many lower-preference categories, immigrant
    visas under EB-2 are currently available for most countries, allowing many
    applicants to proceed with adjustment of status or consular processing
    without delay. Even for applicants from countries facing EB-2 visa backlogs,
    an NIW can still offer advantages, especially when combined with certain
    valid non-immigrant statuses.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>
      Regional Benefits of Petitioning Under the National Interest Waiver (NIW)
    </strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    Based on our extensive experience, we have identified specific advantages of
    filing an NIW for clients from certain regions and nationalities.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>
      <span>China</span>
    </strong>
    <strong>Benefits of NIW Approval for Individuals Born in China</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    Since EB-2 visas are currently unavailable for individuals born in China,
    applicants must wait for permanent residency even after I-140 approval.
    However, filing for an NIW can be highly beneficial, especially for those
    without a strong EB-1A case but who maintain valid non-immigrant status.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Benefits of NIW Approval for H-1B Holders from China</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    Many Chinese clients maintain lawful presence in the U.S. through the H-1B
    program. Filing for NIW allows them to secure I-140 approval and wait for an
    immigrant visa while continuing employment. Since H-1B permits immigrant
    intent, applicants can travel internationally and extend their status beyond
    the standard six years. An approved I-140 enables H-1B extensions in
    three-year increments until a green card becomes available. Additionally,
    H-4 dependents of these applicants may qualify for Employment Authorization
    Documents (EADs). In short, NIW approval offers both legal stability and
    family work authorization benefits.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>
      Benefits of NIW Approval for F-1 (OPT/STEM) Holders from China
    </strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    Students and graduates on F-1 status, including OPT and STEM extensions, can
    also benefit from NIW approval. Although EB-2 retrogression for Chinese
    applicants is typically 3–5 years, F-1/OPT/STEM status often allows
    sufficient time to remain lawfully in the U.S. while waiting. With proper
    filing strategy and timing, NIW can provide a bridge toward permanent
    residency. However, since the F-1 visa does not permit dual intent,
    applicants should consult with an attorney before filing I-140, as doing so
    could complicate international travel and status renewals.
    <br />
    <br />
    Overall, NIW approval offers significant long-term benefits for Chinese
    nationals, even if immediate permanent residency is not possible.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>
      <span>India</span>
      <br />
      <br />
    </strong>
    <strong>Benefits of NIW Approval for Individuals Born in India</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    Like applicants from China, Indian-born individuals face EB-2 visa
    retrogression, with even longer backlogs. Still, filing for NIW remains
    beneficial, especially for those who may not qualify under EB-1A but
    maintain valid non-immigrant status. H-1B holders from India, in particular,
    gain significant advantages, including extended lawful presence and
    employment authorization for their dependents. With an approved I-140, they
    can extend H-1B status in three-year increments until a visa becomes
    available. This ensures both continuity of employment and family stability
    while awaiting permanent residency.
    <br />
    <br />
    Thus, despite long visa wait times, NIW approval provides Indian nationals
    with a secure path to remain in the U.S. lawfully.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Benefits of NIW Approval for Individuals Born in Iran</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    A large portion of our NIW clients are from Iran, many of whom are in STEM
    fields, and their petitions enjoy a high approval rate. Unlike applicants
    from India and China, Iranians benefit from EB-2 visas currently being
    available. This means they can proceed directly to adjustment of status or
    immigrant visa processing after I-140 approval without long delays. Combined
    with a generally lower evidentiary threshold, NIW offers an excellent option
    for Iranian applicants, even early in their careers.
    <br />
    <br />
    We have also successfully represented Iranian clients applying from abroad,
    including Canada, Europe, and Iran itself, based on their professional
    achievements and research contributions.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>
      <span>Taiwan, Vietnam, South Korea, Nepal, Pakistan, and Others</span>
    </strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    Like Iranian applicants, individuals from these countries benefit greatly
    from NIW approval, as EB-2 visas are currently available for most
    nationalities (except India and China). This allows applicants to apply for
    permanent residency without delay, while also requiring a relatively lower
    evidentiary burden compared to other categories.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>
      Benefits for Applicants from <u>Taiwan</u>
    </strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    With EB-2 visas available, Taiwanese nationals with NIW approval can
    immediately apply for green cards. Many of our successful Taiwanese clients
    were in STEM programs, and both F-1/OPT/STEM and H-1B holders have achieved
    high approval rates through our firm. Visa status itself has not been a
    limiting factor as long as applicants meet legal requirements.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>
      Benefits for Applicants from <u>Vietnam</u>
    </strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    Many Vietnamese clients have secured NIW approvals, though some face
    challenges under J-1 visa restrictions requiring a two-year home residency.
    While the J-1 requirement complicates timelines, it does not prevent NIW
    approval. With careful planning, many Vietnamese applicants successfully
    transitioned to green cards through NIW.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>
      Benefits for Applicants from <u>South Korea</u>
    </strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    We have a strong record of NIW approvals for South Korean nationals,
    including those applying from abroad. Many were employed by internationally
    recognized companies such as Samsung. Their professional achievements and
    expertise enabled us to secure approvals even without a U.S. job offer.

    title: "What does NIW stand for?",
    content: (
      <>
        <p>
          <strong>NIW</strong> stands for{" "}
          <strong>National Interest Waiver</strong>, which is a subcategory of
          the
          <strong> EB-2 employment-based green card</strong> process. Normally,
          the EB-2 category requires a<strong>job offer</strong> and an
          employer-obtained <strong> labor certification (PERM)</strong>. The
          labor certification ensures that no qualified U.S. workers are
          available for the position, protecting the domestic workforce.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the <strong>National Interest Waiver (NIW)</strong>, however,
          applicants can request that the job offer and labor certification
          requirement be <strong>waived</strong>. To qualify, they must
          demonstrate that granting them permanent residency would serve the{" "}
          <strong>national interest</strong> of the United States. This makes it
          possible for individuals to self-petition without employer
          sponsorship.
        </p>
        <p>
          The legal foundation for NIW petitions was established in the
          precedent decision
          <em>Matter of Dhanasar</em> (2016) and was further clarified in the
          January 2025 USCIS policy update, which outlines how officers evaluate
          proposed endeavors, applicants' qualifications, and national interest
          factors

    title: "Is NIW a green card?",
    content: (
      <>
        <p>
          The <strong>EB-2 NIW (National Interest Waiver)</strong> is not a
          green card by itself, but rather a<strong> pathway</strong> within the
          U.S. green card process. It allows individuals to
          <strong>self-petition</strong> under the{" "}
          <strong>EB-2 employment-based second preference</strong> category.
          When your <strong>Form I-140</strong> for NIW is approved, it
          establishes your <strong>eligibility </strong>
          for a green card under the EB-2 category. However, I-140 approval is{" "}
          <strong>only the first step</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To actually obtain <strong>lawful permanent residency</strong> (i.e.,
          your green card), you must complete the second stage of the process:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Adjustment of Status (Form I-485)</strong> if applying from
            within the United States; or
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Consular Processing</strong> at a U.S. embassy or consulate
            if applying from abroad.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This stage depends on <strong>visa availability</strong>, which is
          determined by the monthly
          <strong> Visa Bulletin</strong> published by the U.S. Department of
          State. As of 2025, the EB-2 category is retrogressed across all
          countries. For applicants born outside India and China, the typical
          wait is around <strong>1–2 years</strong>. For applicants from{" "}
          <strong>China</strong>, the wait is generally
          <strong> 4–5 years</strong>, while for <strong>India</strong>, the
          backlog is considerably longer. These timelines may change based on
          visa supply and demand, but retrogression continues to be an important
          factor in green card planning.

    title:
      "What are the differences between Regular EB2 visa and EB2 NIW (National Interest Waiver) petitions?",
    content: (
      <>
        <p>
          In a traditional <strong>EB2 petition</strong>, a{" "}
          <strong>U.S. employer</strong> serves as the{" "}
          <strong>petitioner</strong>. The employer must complete the{" "}
          <strong>labor certification (PERM)</strong> process with the U.S.
          Department of Labor to prove that no minimally qualified U.S. worker
          is available for the position. Once PERM is approved, the employer
          files <strong>Form I-140</strong> on behalf of the foreign national
          (the <strong>beneficiary</strong>).
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast, under the <strong>EB2 NIW</strong>, the foreign national
          can <strong>self-petition</strong>. This means:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            No <strong>job offer</strong> or{" "}
            <strong>labor certification</strong> is required.
          </li>
          <li>
            The petitioner must first meet standard{" "}
            <strong>EB2 eligibility criteria</strong> (advanced degree or
            exceptional ability), and also demonstrate that waiving the job
            offer and labor certification is in the{" "}
            <strong>national interest</strong> of the United States.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          USCIS evaluates NIW petitions using the{" "}
          <strong>three-prong test</strong> from the{" "}
          <strong>
            <em>Matter of Dhanasar</em> (2016)
          </strong>{" "}
          precedent:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The proposed endeavor has <strong>substantial merit</strong> and{" "}
            <strong>national importance</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The applicant is <strong>well positioned</strong> to advance the
            proposed endeavor.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>On balance</strong>, it would benefit the U.S. to waive the
            job offer and labor certification requirements.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Because of this additional standard,{" "}
          <strong>EB2 NIW petitions</strong> are generally more challenging than
          regular EB2 filings. However, at{" "}
          <strong>North America Immigration Law Group</strong>, we have
          successfully guided over
          <strong>40,000 clients</strong> to EB2 NIW approval. For cases covered
          by our Approval or Refund<sup>®</sup>
          service, our approval rate has stayed
          <strong>above 99%</strong> for the past 10 consecutive years.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <strong>January 2025 USCIS policy update</strong> further
          underscores the need to
          <strong>define the endeavor with specificity</strong> and align it
          with <strong>U.S. national priorities</strong>.

        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Labor Certification (PERM)</strong>: Normally, an employer
            must test the U.S. labor market to confirm no qualified U.S. worker
            is available. This step is{" "}
            <strong>time-consuming and uncertain</strong>. NIW waives it
            entirely.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Job Offer Requirement</strong>: Regular EB2 petitions
            require a full-time, permanent job offer from a U.S. employer. NIW
            allows applicants to qualify based on their own{" "}
            <strong>credentials</strong> and <strong>proposed endeavor</strong>,
            even if self-employed, engaged in independent research, or launching

        <p>
          This waiver is granted only if the petitioner convincingly

            <em>Matter of Dhanasar</em>

          To qualify for an <strong>EB2 NIW</strong>, an applicant must first
          meet the requirements of the
          <strong>
            EB2 category (Second Preference Employment-Based Immigration)
          </strong>{" "}
          in one of two ways:
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1. EB2 “Advanced Degree”</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          You qualify if you hold:
          <ul>
            <li>
              An <strong>advanced degree</strong> (U.S. or foreign master’s,
              Ph.D., MD/MBBS, or equivalent); or
            </li>

              in your field.
            </li>
          </ul>
          While a Ph.D. often strengthens the case, it is{" "}
          <strong>not strictly required</strong>.

        <p>
          <strong>2. EB2 “Exceptional Ability”</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Applicants who do not meet the advanced degree standard may qualify by
          showing <strong>exceptional ability</strong> in their field. This
          requires evidence meeting at least <strong>three</strong> of the
          following criteria:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Academic record (degree, diploma, or certificate in the area of
            ability)
          </li>
          <li>Letters verifying at least 10 years of full-time experience</li>
          <li>License or certification for the profession</li>
          <li>Evidence of high salary or other significant remuneration</li>
          <li>Membership in professional associations</li>
          <li>
            Recognition for achievements and contributions by peers, government
            bodies, or professional organizations
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Comparable evidence</strong> may also be accepted if the above
          do not apply neatly. USCIS reviews the petition
          <strong>holistically</strong>, weighing the field of work, the
          relevance of evidence, and the applicant’s overall impact.
        </p>
        <p>

          A <strong>foreign medical degree</strong> may be considered equivalent

          requirements. According to 2025 policy guidance, applicants must

        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The medical school required a <strong>bachelor’s degree</strong> (or

          </li>
          <li>
            A <strong>credential evaluation</strong> from a recognized agency
            shows equivalency to a U.S. M.D. in terms of coursework, program
            length, and clinical training.
          </li>
          <li>
            Optionally, passing the <strong>USMLE</strong> (Steps 1–3) or the

            claims.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          USCIS evaluates each case individually. Supporting documentation may
          include <strong>credential evaluations</strong>,
          <strong>exam score reports</strong>, and evidence of the medical
          school’s structure and rigor. Applicants seeking{" "}
          <strong>clinical practice</strong> in the U.S. should also provide

          and recognition may suffice.

        <p>
          Overall, USCIS applies a <strong>holistic analysis</strong>, requiring
          proof that the foreign medical education is substantially equivalent
          in <strong>rigor, content, and outcomes</strong> to a U.S. M.D. Expert
          opinion letters and national-level recognition may also strengthen the
          case.

        <p>
          <strong>A. Substantial Merit</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The petitioner must show that the proposed endeavor carries{" "}
          <strong>substantial merit</strong>. As clarified in the January 2025
          USCIS policy update, this means the endeavor should aim to{" "}
          <strong>solve a meaningful problem</strong>,{" "}
          <strong>advance knowledge</strong>, or{" "}
          <strong>improve societal well-being</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>Fields where substantial merit may apply include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Science and technology</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Healthcare and public health</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Education</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Entrepreneurship and business</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Public policy and the arts</strong>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The work does not need to create{" "}
          <strong>immediate economic benefits</strong>, but it must demonstrate
          a <strong>clear contribution</strong> to its field or society.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Examples of persuasive evidence include:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A <strong>detailed endeavor description</strong> outlining its
            goals, scope, and relevance;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Research papers</strong>, white papers, or other
            documentation showing its significance;
          </li>
          <li>

          <strong>B. National Importance</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The national importance requirement focuses on whether the endeavor’s
          impact extends beyond the individual or local level. According to
          USCIS’s 2025 clarification, officers will consider whether the
          endeavor:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Has <strong>national or international impact</strong> within its
            field;
          </li>
          <li>
            Supports <strong>U.S. government initiatives</strong> or addresses
            recognized public challenges;
          </li>
          <li>
            Promotes <strong>economic growth</strong>,{" "}
            <strong>public health</strong>, <strong>climate resilience</strong>,{" "}
            <strong>technological progress</strong>, or other major goals.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Evidence may include:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A comprehensive <strong>proposed endeavor statement</strong>{" "}
            explaining how the work aligns with national priorities;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Government grants or funding</strong> (e.g., NIH, NSF, DOE,
            DoD) showing formal support;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Letters of endorsement</strong> from U.S. agencies or
            officials;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Citations, media coverage</strong>, or recognition in
            national strategies or reports.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Together, the evidence should show that the endeavor is both{" "}
          <strong>valuable in its field</strong> and has{" "}
          <strong>broad national significance</strong>. USCIS places emphasis on
          measurable{" "}

    content: (
      <>
        <p>
          Under the third prong of Dhanasar, USCIS applies a{" "}
          <strong>balancing test</strong> to determine whether the{" "}
          <strong>
            foreign national’s contributions outweigh the benefits of labor
            market protections
          </strong>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          As outlined in <strong>2025 USCIS guidance</strong>, adjudicators
          consider:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If the applicant has <strong>specialized expertise</strong> that
            makes labor certification impractical;

          <li>
            If the work <strong>generates jobs</strong>,{" "}
            <strong>drives innovation</strong>, or{" "}
            <strong>strengthens U.S. competitiveness</strong>;
          </li>
          <li>
            If the petition <strong>explains clearly</strong> why bypassing
            labor certification better serves the public interest.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The case must be presented as a <strong>cohesive package</strong>,
          where all documentation and support letters collectively demonstrate
          that labor certification would <strong>delay or hinder</strong>{" "}

        <p>
          <strong>Publications &amp; Citations:</strong> A complete list of
          peer-reviewed works with <strong>citation analysis</strong>, including
          journal impact factors. <strong>Quality and relevance</strong> carry
          more weight than raw numbers.

          <strong>Support Letters:</strong> Still a key component. Letters are
          strongest when written by{" "}

          <strong>Government Grants:</strong> Participation in research

          the applicant’s specific role.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Memberships:</strong> Selective memberships that require{" "}

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Awards:</strong> Competitive, widely recognized{" "}

          persuasive.

          <strong>External Reliance:</strong> Evidence of other institutions or

          <strong>Yes.</strong> Applicants may submit petitions under multiple

  <strong>National Interest Waiver (NIW) for Entrepreneurs</strong> <br /><br />
    <p>
      Thanks to recent updates in the <b>USCIS Policy Manual</b>, entrepreneurs now have
      a clearer pathway to secure a green card through the National Interest Waiver (NIW).
      Unlike traditional immigration routes requiring employer sponsorship, the NIW empowers
      entrepreneurs to self-petition if they can demonstrate that their work significantly benefits
      the United States. This page explains how founders and innovators can use the NIW to
      establish and grow businesses in the U.S. while driving economic growth, innovation,
      and societal impact.
    </p>
    <br />

  <strong>What is the NIW for Entrepreneurs?</strong><br /><br />
  <p>
    The National Interest Waiver allows qualified individuals to bypass labor
    certification and employer sponsorship if their endeavor holds substantial merit and
    national importance. While historically associated with researchers and academics,
    recent policy updates emphasize its relevance to entrepreneurs. To qualify,
    applicants must show that their venture benefits the U.S. and that they are
    well-positioned to advance it successfully.
