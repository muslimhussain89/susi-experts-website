        The EB-2 National Interest Waiver (NIW) is a special provision under the
        second preference employment-based immigration category that allows
        eligible individuals to apply for permanent residency on their own,
        without needing a job offer or employer sponsorship. It is designed for
        those whose work holds significant merit and national importance, making
        the traditional labor market test unnecessary for the nation’s best
        interests. <br />
        <br />
        Normally, EB-2 petitions require a
        <strong> permanent, full-time job offer </strong> from a U.S. employer
        along with an approved labor certification from the Department of
        Labor—a lengthy process meant to prove that no qualified U.S. worker is
        available for the role. This requirement often creates a heavy burden
        for employers and restricts opportunities for foreign nationals without
        sponsorship. Consequently, many employers hesitate to sponsor EB-2
        candidates due to the cost and time involved in labor certification.{" "}
        <br />
        <br />
        Under the National Interest Waiver (NIW), individuals can ask USCIS to
        waive the usual job offer and labor certification requirements by
        showing that their work benefits the national interest of the United
        States. This allows for self-petitioning, meaning applicants can
        independently file Form I-140 and provide evidence of both EB-2
        eligibility and qualification for the waiver. <br />
        <br /> To qualify, petitioners must meet the EB-2 criteria{" "}
        <ul>
          <li>
            either as professionals with an advanced degree (or its equivalent)
          </li>{" "}
          <li>
            or as individuals with exceptional ability in the sciences, arts, or
            business.
          </li>
        </ul>{" "}
        After that, they must satisfy the three-prong test from the AAO’s
        landmark Matter of Dhanasar decision (2016), which evaluates the
        national importance of their work, their qualifications, and whether
        waiving the job offer and labor certification benefits the U.S.
        <br />
        <br /> On January 15, 2025, USCIS issued an important policy update
        further clarifying how EB-2 NIW petitions are assessed, refining key
        evaluation standards. The updated USCIS guidance clarifies several
        important aspects of NIW petitions, including:
        <ul>
          <li>How to define and clearly explain the proposed endeavor.</li>
          <li>
            How the petitioner’s qualifications relate to their proposed work.
          </li>
          <li>
            How both dependent and independent recommendation letters are
            evaluated.
          </li>
        </ul>
        The significance of endorsements from U.S. government and
        quasi-government entities. At North America Immigration Law Group, our
        extensive experience with thousands of NIW cases shows that the current
        framework is more transparent and accessible to professionals from
        diverse fields. By combining established legal precedent with clearer
        guidance, the EB-2 NIW continues to be a crucial pathway for individuals
        whose skills and contributions advance the national interest of the
        United States.

      <>
        A strong national interest argument alone isn’t enough to qualify for a
        National Interest Waiver (NIW). While the NIW removes the need for a job
        offer and labor certification, applicants must still meet the core EB-2
        requirements. <br />
        <br /> This means qualifying either as a professional with an advanced
        degree (or its equivalent) or as an individual with exceptional ability
        in the sciences, arts, or business. <br />
        <br /> Only after meeting the EB-2 criteria will USCIS evaluate whether
        granting the waiver serves the national interest.

    title: "What is 'National Interest' ?",
    content: (
      <>
        The term “national interest” is not strictly defined in law, but the
        Immigration Act of 1990 clarifies that a National Interest Waiver (NIW)
        under the EB-2 category must meet a standard “significantly above that
        necessary to prove prospective national benefit.” In other words, not
        every beneficial contribution qualifies—the petitioner must show that
        waiving the job offer and labor certification provides benefits of
        substantial magnitude to the nation.
        <br />
        <br />
        USCIS applies this standard flexibly, reviewing each case on its own
        merits, with the burden of proof on the petitioner to demonstrate a
        clear national benefit. Historically, USCIS has considered contributions
        that have a direct and tangible impact on national priorities, such as:
        <ul>
          <li>Advancing the U.S. economy.</li>
          <li>Improving wages or working conditions for U.S. workers.</li>
          <li>
            Supporting affordable housing initiatives for vulnerable groups.
          </li>
          <li>
            Enhancing the environment or promoting efficient use of natural
            resources.
          </li>
          <li>
            Contributions specifically requested or endorsed by U.S. government
            agencies.
          </li>
        </ul>
        Beyond economic or scientific impact, USCIS may also weigh cultural,
        public welfare, and national security benefits, provided there’s a clear
        link between the petitioner’s work and the claimed benefit. At North
        America Immigration Law Group, our extensive experience shows that USCIS
        recognizes a wide range of professions and endeavors as meeting the NIW
        standard—what matters most is demonstrating that your specific work has
        substantial merit, national relevance, and meaningful societal impact.

      "Matter of Dhanasar: The Current Standard for National Interest Waivers",
    content: (
      <>
        On December 27, 2016 , the Administrative Appeals Office (AAO) issued
        the landmark decision in Matter of Dhanasar , which set the current
        standard for evaluating EB-2 National Interest Waiver (NIW) petitions.
        <br />
        <br />
        This ruling introduced a more flexible and modern framework for
        determining when a waiver of the job offer and labor certification
        requirements is justified. Under the Dhanasar test , a petitioner must
        show that:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            The proposed endeavor has substantial merit and national importance.
          </li>
          <li>
            The petitioner is well-positioned to advance the proposed endeavor.
          </li>
          <li>
            On balance, waiving the job offer and labor certification benefits
            the United States.
          </li>
          <li>
            This three-prong test now forms the foundation of all EB-2 NIW
            adjudications.

      "How to Meet the Requirements for a National Interest Waiver Based on Matter of Dhanasar",
    content: (
      <>
        <br />
        <strong>1. Substantial Merit and National Importance</strong> <br />
        <br />
        To meet the first prong of the Matter of Dhanasar framework, the
        petitioner must show that the proposed endeavor carries both substantial
        merit and national importance. As clarified in the January 2025 USCIS
        policy update, these are separate concepts but are evaluated together to
        determine the broader significance of the work. <br />
        <br />
        <strong>1.1 Substantial merit</strong> <br />
        <br /> can be demonstrated across diverse fields such as science,
        technology, healthcare, education, business, public policy, and the
        arts. The endeavor does not need to provide immediate economic gains;
        instead, it should address an important issue, advance knowledge or
        practices in its field, or improve societal well-being.
        <br /> <br /> Supporting evidence may include:
        <br /> <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            A clear and well-structured description of the proposed endeavor,
            detailing its goals, scope, and relevance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Research publications, technical reports, or documentation that
            substantiate its merit.
          </li>
          <li>
            Recommendation letters explaining the value and impact of the work
            in accessible terms.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <strong>1.2: National Importance</strong> <br />
        <br />
        The national importance aspect looks at the impact of the proposed
        endeavor beyond a purely local or individual level. According to the
        2025 USCIS policy update , there is now greater emphasis on how clearly
        the petitioner defines their endeavor and whether it aligns with U.S.
        government priorities or addresses significant, publicly recognized
        challenges.
        <br />
        <br />
        Key factors USCIS considers include:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Whether the endeavor has national or global significance within its
            field.
          </li>
          <li>
            Whether it supports U.S. government initiatives or national
            priorities (e.g., public health, energy sustainability, AI
            innovation, climate resilience).
          </li>
          <li>
            Whether it contributes to economic growth, equity, public safety, or
            the advancement of knowledge
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        Examples of persuasive evidence may include:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Federal or state funding (e.g., NIH, NSF, DOE, DOD) for projects
            related to the petitioner’s work.
          </li>
          <li>
            Documentation or endorsements showing the endeavor’s alignment with
            national strategies or priority areas.
          </li>
          <li>
            Recognition from relevant organizations or agencies highlighting its
            broader societal impact.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <strong>
          2. Well Positioned to Advance the Proposed Endeavor
        </strong>{" "}
        <br />
        <br />
        The second prong of the Dhanasar framework requires petitioners to show
        they are well positioned to carry out their proposed endeavor . USCIS
        looks for evidence that the petitioner has the qualifications,
        expertise, and proven track record necessary to successfully advance the
        work.
        <br />
        <br />
        Factors USCIS considers include:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Academic degrees and professional training relevant to the endeavor.
          </li>
          <li>Specialized skills, certifications, or technical expertise.</li>
          <li>
            Documented prior achievements such as publications, patents,
            projects, or awards.
          </li>
          <li>
            Demonstrated progress toward the endeavor’s goals (e.g., early
            results, collaborations, product development).
          </li>
          <li>
            {" "}
            Recognition, support, or investment from third parties like
            institutions, investors, or government agencies.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        Supporting evidence may include: <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Detailed recommendation letters that specifically address the
            petitioner’s expertise and contributions.
          </li>
          <li>Records of key roles in funded or government-backed projects.</li>
          <li>
            Memberships, awards, or honors that recognize professional
            excellence.
          </li>
          <li>
            Media coverage or invited talks highlighting impact in the field.
          </li>
          <li>
            Proof of commercialization, licensing, or adoption of the
            petitioner’s work by others.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        While absolute certainty of success is not required, USCIS places
        significant weight on credible, detailed, and corroborated evidence .
        Vague or unsupported statements will not suffice; specificity and
        documentation are essential.
        <br />
        <br />
        At our firm, we leverage evidentiary strategies often used in EB-1A and
        EB-2 Exceptional Ability cases to strengthen NIW petitions, tailoring
        each filing to highlight unique strengths.
        <br />
        <br /> Common persuasive evidence includes: <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Publications & citation records: Showing influence and recognition
            in the field.
          </li>
          <li>
            Recommendation letters: From experts with direct knowledge of
            achievements and impact.
          </li>
          <li>
            Government grants: Participation in federally funded research or
            projects.
          </li>
          <li>
            Selective memberships: In organizations that require notable
            accomplishments.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prestigious awards: Nationally or internationally recognized honors.
          </li>
          <li>
            Published material about the petitioner: Media or scholarly articles
            validating contributions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Patents, contracts, or licenses: Proof of practical applications and
            value.
          </li>
          <li>
            External reliance: Documentation of others depending on the
            petitioner’s expertise.
          </li>
          <li>
            Critical roles: Evidence of leadership or indispensable
            contributions in high-value projects.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <strong>
          3. Balancing Test: Demonstrating Why Waiving the Job Offer and Labor
          Certification Serves the U.S. National Interest
        </strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        The third prong of the <b>Matter of Dhanasar</b> framework involves a{" "}
        <b>balancing analysis</b>—assessing whether, overall, it would benefit
        the United States to
        <b>waive the job offer and labor certification requirements</b>. This
        evaluation weighs the petitioner’s anticipated contributions to the
        national interest against the policy goal of the labor certification
        process, which is designed to protect U.S. workers and the labor market.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Relevant factors USCIS may take into account include:</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            The petitioner possesses rare or highly specialized expertise,
            making the labor certification process impractical or unlikely to
            succeed.
          </li>
          <li>
            The proposed work is time-sensitive or urgent and could be
            significantly delayed by labor certification procedures.
          </li>
          <li>
            The petitioner’s self-employment is structured in a way that does
            not negatively affect U.S. workers.
          </li>
          <li>
            The endeavor is anticipated to generate jobs, drive economic growth,
            or strengthen U.S. competitiveness .
          </li>
          <li>
            Even if qualified U.S. workers exist, the petitioner’s contributions
            provide a level of benefit that surpasses what labor market testing
            seeks to protect.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        Importantly, USCIS does not require proof that labor certification is
        impossible—only that waiving it produces greater overall benefits. This
        prong is especially advantageous for entrepreneurs, independent
        researchers, and public-interest innovators whose work is not tied to
        one employer or a narrowly defined job role.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Types of evidence that can help meet this requirement include:</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            A detailed statement or legal brief explaining why the labor
            certification process is not well-suited to the petitioner’s
            specific endeavor.
          </li>
          <li>
            Proof that securing a traditional job offer is not feasible or that
            standard employment arrangements would impede the petitioner’s
            contributions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Letters of support or endorsements from agencies, institutions, or
            collaborators emphasizing the urgency and national value of the
            work.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        The petitioner’s argument should focus on showing that{" "}
        <b>
          the advantages of permitting their contributions to move forward
          without delay or restriction outweigh the benefits of traditional
          labor market safeguards
        </b>
        . When the first two prongs are solidly established, the third prong is
        typically supported through a cohesive and well-substantiated case
        presentation.

        <br />
        <br /> Officers now evaluate whether the applicant’s occupation
        qualifies as a “profession” under INA 101(a)(32) and if a bachelor’s
        degree plus five years of progressive experience fulfills the
        requirements of that profession.

        Essential components of a <b>well-articulated endeavor</b> include:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Specific Goals and Scope</b> – Clearly outline what the

            anticipated outcomes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Execution Plan</b> – Specify whether the endeavor will be carried
            out through employment with an organization, independently, or via
            entrepreneurial or self-directed research activities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>National Relevance</b> – Explain how the endeavor aligns with
            larger U.S. priorities, such as economic growth, public health,
            environmental sustainability, national security, or advancements in
            science and technology.
          </li>
        </ol>
        USCIS evaluates the endeavor’s impact based on its{" "}
        <b>
          expected influence within the field and its alignment with national
          objectives

        , rather than limiting consideration to local or employer-specific
        benefits. A persuasive statement detailing <i>what</i> the petitioner
        will do, <i>how</i> they will do it, and <i>why</i> it matters on a
        national scale has become central to petition approval.

        <b>3. Updated Expectations for Recommendation Letters</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The <b>2025 USCIS policy update</b> emphasizes that the strength of a
        recommendation letter is determined by its content rather than the
        independence of the writer. USCIS now prioritizes letters from
        individuals with <b>direct knowledge</b> of the petitioner’s work—such
        as supervisors, collaborators, or project leaders.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>What Defines a Strong Letter?</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        For a National Interest Waiver petition, an effective recommendation
        letter should:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>
            Highlight the petitioner’s <b>specific accomplishments</b>,

          <li>
            Show how the petitioner is <b>well positioned</b> to advance their
            proposed endeavor based on experience, skills, and demonstrated
            success;
          </li>
          <li>
            Explain the <b>national significance</b> of the petitioner’s work,
            referencing its contributions to public policy, science, economic
            development, or other U.S. priorities;

        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>
            Letters offering <b>specific, detailed examples</b> rather than
            generic praise;

        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          Generic, vague, or repetitive letters can weaken a petition.
          Statements like “widely respected in the field” without supporting
          details or context add little value and may fail to persuade
          adjudicators.

// ************************ Requirements For Petitioning For the National Interest Waiver (NIW)  **********************************************
// **************************************************************************************************

export const nivRequirements = [
  <>
    There are several factors to keep in mind when determining if pursuing a
    petition under this category is appropriate for you. While every case is
    unique and should be evaluated by qualified immigration attorneys, the
    following general considerations may help assess whether the National
    Interest Waiver (NIW) could be a suitable option.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>EB-2 Eligibility Is Required</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    It is important to understand that meeting the NIW criteria does not itself
    establish EB-2 eligibility. Rather, the NIW only waives the job offer and
    labor certification requirements otherwise associated with EB-2. Before
    considering an NIW petition, the applicant must first confirm that they
    qualify for EB-2 classification.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>EB-2 Requirements: Advanced Degree or Exceptional Ability</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    To qualify for EB-2 status, the petitioner must either: 1) hold an advanced
    degree, or 2) demonstrate exceptional ability in their field.
    <br />
    <br />
    Most applicants meet EB-2 qualifications through an advanced degree. This
    can be shown in two primary ways: (1) holding a U.S. academic or
    professional degree above the baccalaureate level, or a foreign equivalent
    degree evaluated as comparable; or (2) possessing a U.S. bachelor’s degree
    (or its foreign equivalent) <span>plus</span> at least five years of
    progressive, post-baccalaureate professional experience. USCIS treats the
    combination of a bachelor’s degree and five years of qualifying experience
    as equivalent to a U.S. master’s degree.
    <br />
    <br />
    Alternatively, applicants without an advanced degree may establish EB-2
    eligibility by showing exceptional ability in their field—meaning a level of
    expertise significantly above what is typically encountered in their
    profession.
    <br />
    <br />
    After meeting these minimum EB-2 criteria, a job offer and a labor
    certification from the Department of Labor (DOL) are normally required.
    Outside the NIW context, this means the employer must file on behalf of the
    beneficiary; self-petitioning is not permitted. Due to these added
    requirements, many applicants consider the NIW route, which allows qualified
    individuals to self-petition without the need for a job offer or labor
    certification.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>
      NIW Standard Under the AAO Decision – Matter of Dhanasar (December 27,
      2016)
    </strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    Once basic EB-2 eligibility is established, the applicant must also
    demonstrate that they qualify for the NIW in order to bypass the job offer
    and labor certification requirements, or to self-petition.
    <br />
    <br />
    Previously, USCIS applied the three-part test from{" "}
    <i>New York State Dept. of Transportation</i>, 22 I&amp;N Dec. 215 (Comm.
    1998) (“NYSDOT”), which required showing:
    <br />
    <br />
    <ol>
      <li>The work had “substantial intrinsic merit”;</li>
      <li>The benefits of the proposed employment were “national in scope”;</li>
      <li>
        The petitioner served the “national interest to a substantially greater
        degree” than an otherwise qualified U.S. worker, such that requiring a
        labor certification would harm the national interest.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    However, on December 27, 2016, the Administrative Appeals Office (AAO)
    issued a decision in <i>Matter of Dhanasar</i>, replacing the NYSDOT test
    with a new analytical framework. Under <i>Dhanasar</i>, USCIS may grant a
    National Interest Waiver if the applicant establishes the following three
    criteria:
    <br />
    <br />
    <ol>
      <li>
        The proposed endeavor has both substantial merit and national
        importance;
      </li>
      <li>
        The petitioner is well positioned to advance the proposed endeavor;
      </li>
      <li>
        On balance, it would benefit the United States to waive the job offer
        and labor certification requirements.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    <strong>1. Substantial Merit and National Importance </strong> <br /> <br />
    To meet the first prong under <i>Matter of Dhanasar</i>, the petitioner must
    show that their proposed endeavor has both substantial merit and national
    importance. This requires demonstrating that the work is tied to a
    significant national goal and benefits the United States. The endeavor’s
    merit can arise in various fields, such as business, entrepreneurship,
    science, technology, culture, health, or education.
    <br /> <br />
    USCIS evaluates national importance based on the endeavor’s potential
    prospective impact, considering its broader implications beyond a specific
    geographic region. For example, a physician working in a single hospital may
    appear to benefit only the local area, but if their research is published
    nationally or their techniques are adopted in hospitals across the U.S.,
    their work can be deemed nationally important.
    <br /> <br />
    Scientific research often naturally aligns with national interests, such as
    public health or safety. However, many other fields may also meet this
    criterion when their contributions have wider societal value. Below are
    examples of endeavors that have been found to possess substantial merit and
    national importance:
    <br /> <br />
    <ul>
      <li>
        A postdoctoral researcher in medicinal chemistry developing anti-viral
        and anti-cancer drugs impacting U.S. healthcare.
      </li>
      <li>
        A civil engineer improving asphalt durability, enhancing transportation
        infrastructure and safety.
      </li>
      <li>
        A petroleum engineering consultant increasing energy efficiency and
        advancing environmentally sustainable practices.
      </li>
      <li>
        An opera singer contributing to cultural enrichment and vocal health
        knowledge.
      </li>
      <li>An animator advancing American art and design.</li>
      <li>
        A gastroenterology physician improving diagnostic and treatment methods
        nationwide.
      </li>
      <li>An entrepreneur boosting economic growth and job creation.</li>
      <li>
        An economics researcher contributing to risk management and U.S.
        economic stability.
      </li>
      <li>
        An oncology researcher advancing cancer therapy development impacting
        healthcare nationally.
      </li>
      <li>
        A physician developing diagnostic practices implemented across the U.S.
      </li>
      <li>
        A postdoctoral electrochemistry researcher improving battery performance
        with nationwide applications.
      </li>
      <li>
        A musician contributing to national arts and culture through
        performances and distribution of work.
      </li>
      <li>
        A geologist studying mineral-water reactions to improve U.S. water
        safety.
      </li>
      <li>A web developer producing content and platforms used nationwide.</li>
    </ul>{" "}
    <br />
    <strong>2. Advancing the Proposed Endeavor </strong>
    <br /> <br />
    The second prong focuses on whether the petitioner is well positioned to
    advance the proposed endeavor. USCIS considers factors such as:
    <br /> <br />
    <ul>
      <li>The individual’s education, skills, and specialized knowledge.</li>
      <li>A track record of success in similar or related efforts.</li>
      <li>A clear plan or model for future activities.</li>
      <li>Evidence of progress already made towards the endeavor.</li>
      <li>
        Interest from potential customers, collaborators, investors, or relevant
        institutions.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    Supporting evidence may include detailed expert letters referencing U.S.
    government interest in the petitioner’s work, documentation of involvement
    in government-funded projects, and records of academic credentials,
    professional achievements, memberships, and media coverage relevant to the
    field.
    <br /> <br />
    <strong>
      3. Balancing Test: National Interest vs. Job Offer Requirement{" "}
    </strong>
    <br /> <br />
    The third prong requires showing that, on balance, it benefits the United
    States to waive the job offer and labor certification requirements. USCIS
    may consider whether:
    <br /> <br />
    <ul>
      <li>
        Due to the petitioner’s qualifications or the nature of the endeavor,
        obtaining a job offer or labor certification would be impractical.
      </li>
      <li>
        The U.S. would gain from the petitioner’s contributions even if
        qualified U.S. workers are available.
      </li>
      <li>
        The petitioner’s contributions are of such urgency or importance that
        bypassing the labor certification process is justified.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    Meeting all three prongs strengthens the case for an NIW approval, allowing
    qualified individuals to self-petition and bypass the employer sponsorship
    and labor certification process.
    <br /> <br />
    <p>
      This provision is particularly advantageous for entrepreneurs who have a
      proven track record of contributing to the United States through their
      business endeavors and who are reasonably expected to continue making
      similar contributions in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our firm specializes in crafting compelling arguments to address each
      requirement of this prong and assembling robust supporting documentation
      for every claim presented. When gathering evidence for the third prong, it
      is helpful to review the criteria for EB-1A (Alien of Extraordinary
      Ability) and EB-2 Exceptional Ability. While EB-1A carries a higher legal
      standard and stricter evidentiary thresholds, its criteria can guide the
      types of documentation that effectively demonstrate the applicant’s record
      of achievement and the significance of their proposed work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below is an overview of commonly included evidence in EB-2 NIW (National
      Interest Waiver) petitions, along with explanations for how each type of
      documentation can address NIW requirements:
    </p>
    <br /> <br />
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Publications &amp; Citation Records</b>
        <br />
        Include a complete list of publications (journal articles, book
        chapters, books) to highlight the petitioner’s contributions. However,
        publication alone does not establish influence; citation records are
        important to show how the work has been adopted by other researchers.
        Supporting details such as journal impact factors and field-specific
        citation averages can further demonstrate above-average influence. There
        is no specific citation count required for NIW approval, and various
        strategies can be used to offset a low citation record.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>
        <b>Letters of Recommendation</b>
        <br />
        Strong recommendation letters are critical to any NIW case. Independent
        letters (from individuals who have not directly worked with or advised
        the petitioner) carry greater weight with USCIS compared to dependent
        letters. These letters should explain the petitioner’s work and its
        importance in accessible terms and directly comment on its benefit to
        the U.S. Ideally, they should also include examples of how the
        petitioner’s work has been applied. As part of our service, we draft
        tailored recommendation letters, help select the most effective
        recommenders, and ensure each letter includes the necessary elements to
        support the petition.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>
        <b>Government Funding/Grants</b>
        <br />
        Grants or funding from respected organizations or government agencies
        (e.g., NIH, NASA, U.S. Military) are persuasive evidence of the national
        significance of the petitioner’s work. It is crucial to detail the
        petitioner’s active role in securing and contributing to the funded
        projects.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>
        <b>Membership</b>
        <br />
        Membership in organizations within the petitioner’s field can strengthen
        credentials, particularly if they require outstanding accomplishments as
        part of the selection process.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>
        <b>Awards</b>
        <br />
        Nationally or internationally recognized awards can significantly
        enhance an NIW petition. Ideally, these awards should be individually
        granted rather than limited to a specific institution or region. For
        example, an award from the American Chemical Society would likely carry
        significant national recognition.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>
        <b>Published Material About the Petitioner</b>
        <br />
        Media coverage focused on the petitioner and their work, especially when
        featured in nationally or internationally recognized outlets, can help
        demonstrate the broader impact and benefit of their contributions.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>
        <b>Patents, Contracts, Licenses, and Technology Transfers</b>
        <br />A record of patents, along with evidence of citation or
        commercialization, is powerful proof that the petitioner’s work has
        practical applications and has been adopted in the industry. Other
        similar evidence such as contracts, licenses, or technology transfers
        also demonstrates implementation of the petitioner’s contributions.
      </li>
      <br />

      <li>
        <b>Evidence of Others Relying on the Petitioner’s Work</b>
        <br />
        Requests for collaboration or assistance from external researchers, or
        acknowledgments in major industry publications or media, can help show
        the petitioner’s influence and the significance of their work.
      </li>
      <br />
    </ol>
    <p>
      Ultimately, presenting a diverse and cohesive set of evidence is essential
      to demonstrate that the petitioner qualifies for a National Interest
      Waiver. It is not enough to simply list achievements; the petition should
      integrate all components — including recommendation letters and supporting
      evidence — into a unified argument that clearly satisfies each element of
      the three-prong test. At North America Immigration Law Group, our approach
      ensures that every aspect of your NIW petition addresses the necessary
      legal requirements effectively.

    <strong>Approval or Refund</strong>
    <br /> <br />
    We back our work with a clear promise: if your case is not approved, you
    receive a full refund of our attorney’s fee. Few law firms offer a
    comparable commitment. Drawing on proven NIW strategies, we approach every
    petition with complete confidence in the result.
    <br /> <br />
    <strong>Winning Strategies — From Start to Approval</strong>
    <br /> <br />
    From day one, our focus is your approval. After studying thousands of cases
    and relevant decisions, we’ve developed NIW strategies that present your
    qualifications clearly, convincingly, and decisively. While adjudication
    rests with USCIS, as an administrative agency it must apply standards
    consistently—our filings are crafted to align with those standards and
    prevailing policy.
    <br /> <br />
    <strong>Top Law School–Educated Attorneys</strong>
    <br /> <br />
    We staff only Juris Doctor–credentialed attorneys from leading law schools.
    Our team is fluent in the law, USCIS regulations, and case precedent—and
    continually monitors the latest trends and changes. Because immigration
    rules evolve, you need diligent, highly trained counsel to guide your
    petition.
    <br /> <br />
    <strong>Legal Fee</strong>
    <br /> <br />
    Even with comprehensive services—including drafting every USCIS submission
    and, for eligible cases, our approval-or-refund guarantee—our legal fees
    remain competitive and reasonable.
    <br /> <br />
    We were the first immigration firm to offer a refund policy on I-140
    petitions, set out explicitly in the
    <a href="#">attorney–client agreement</a>
    and binding on our firm. Qualified clients may also opt for flexible,
    multi-installment payment plans.
    <br /> <br />
    <strong>What are the payment methods?</strong>
    <br /> <br />
    We accept cash, personal checks, money orders, traveler’s checks, cashier’s
    checks, wire transfers, and online payments via MasterCard and Visa.
    <br /> <br />
    <strong>What does the legal fee include?</strong>
    <br /> <br />
    <ol>
      <li>
        <span>Unlimited Inquiries for the Petition</span>: Once you sign the
        retainer and submit payment, the attorney–client relationship begins and
        continues until the case closes. We will prepare your case promptly,
        thoroughly, and professionally. Our commitment includes:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Strict adherence to the timelines in your contract—your petition
            will not be delayed on our side.
          </li>
          <li>
            Timely responses to your questions—most I-140 preparation inquiries
            are answered within 24 business hours.
          </li>
          <li>
            Availability for scheduled phone consultations with 24 hours’
            notice.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      <li>
        <span>Discussing Potential Recommenders</span>: We review your proposed
        reference list and advise on the strongest candidates for recommendation
        letters.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span>Drafting the Recommendation Letters</span>: Unlike firms that rely
        on templates or charge extra, we draft your recommendation letters.
        Effective letters require deep NIW experience and a nuanced
        understanding of USCIS preferences—well-crafted letters are essential to
        success.
      </li>

      <li>
        Drafting the Petition Letter: We analyze your credentials within our
        proven petition framework and prepare a tailored, strategy-driven
        filing. You will receive the first draft within 10 business days after
        we receive all signed recommendation letters. We will revise the
        petition letter until you are satisfied.
      </li>

      <li>
        Preparing and Filing the Petition Package : After receiving all
        evidence, we prepare exhibits and organize your materials to meet USCIS
        regulations and preferences.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span>
          Responding to RFE (Request for Evidence) or NOID (Notice of Intent to
          Deny) at No Extra Charge
        </span>
        : If USCIS issues an RFE or NOID, we notify you immediately and
        implement a response strategy to secure approval—this may include
        additional recommendation/testimonial letters or a Citation Impact
        Analysis Report. We respond promptly and never miss deadlines.
      </li>

      <li>
        <span>If Denied: Your Choice of Full Refund or Free Re-filing</span>:
        With our approval-or-refund service, if your petition is denied you may
        choose an immediate full refund or a free re-filing. If a re-filed case
        is also denied, our refund policy still applies and we return your
        attorney’s fee.
      </li>

        <br /> <br />
        Once you notify us of your decision to retain our services, we will
        email you a Retainer Agreement tailored to the service package you
        selected. Please review it carefully and reach out to us with any
        questions regarding the terms, services, or payment details.

        checks, money orders, traveler’s checks, cashier’s checks, wire
        transfers, as well as MasterCard and Visa credit cards (online payment

        <br /> <br />
        After we countersign the Retainer Agreement, we will email you a scanned
        copy. At this point, the attorney–client relationship is officially
        established. From then on, we will prepare your case diligently and
        professionally. As your legal counsel, we will:

        receive a client packet via email. This packet provides detailed
        guidance on our process and how we will work together to achieve your
        goals. It includes:

            A detailed questionnaire about your credentials and supporting

        <strong>1. Completing the Questionnaire</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        After receiving your client packet, you will need to carefully complete
        the questionnaire, providing all requested details and supporting
        information.

          <li>
            <span>Identifying Potential Recommenders</span>: Once we review your
            completed questionnaire, we will work with you to identify suitable
            recommenders. Please review the client packet section on
            recommendation letters before this discussion. While there is no
            strict USCIS requirement for the number of letters, 3 to 7 is
            generally considered appropriate.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span>Contacting Recommenders</span>: After finalizing your list,
            you may reach out to your recommenders. We provide sample request
            emails and suggested talking points. Since many recommenders are
            busy professionals, you may let them know that draft letters will be
            prepared for their review and approval.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span>Drafting Recommendation Letters</span>: If your recommenders
            prefer you to provide draft letters (which is common), we will
            prepare them for you. To ensure accuracy, you will need to provide
            us with details about each recommender’s expertise, reputation, and
            connection to your work.
          </li>

          <li>
            <span>Finalizing Recommendation Letters</span>: We will create
            initial drafts and send them to you for feedback. After
            incorporating your revisions, you will forward the finalized drafts
            to your recommenders for their approval and signature. If
            recommenders request changes, we will assist with revisions as
            needed.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <strong>3. Preparing Supporting Documentation</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        While working on recommendation letters, you should also begin gathering
        additional supporting documents, which may include:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>
            Official academic records, diplomas, certificates, or licenses.
          </li>
          <li>
            Letters from past or current employers describing your work and
            contributions.
          </li>
          <li>Evidence of national or international awards.</li>
          <li>Proof of membership in prestigious professional associations.</li>
          <li>
            Published materials about you in reputable publications or
            newspapers (with certified English translations, if needed).
          </li>
          <li>Evidence of judging others’ work (e.g., invitation letters).</li>
          <li>
            Documentation of significant contributions to your field (e.g.,
            expert testimonials).
          </li>
          <li>
            Authorship of scholarly publications (e.g., journal articles, book
            chapters).
          </li>
          <li>
            Evidence of high salary compared to others in your field (e.g.,
            payroll records, employer affidavits).
          </li>
          <li>
            Proof of critical roles held in organizations with strong
            reputations (e.g., employer affidavits).
          </li>
        </ol>

          Fee
        </strong>

        <br />
        Once all recommendation letters and supporting documents are finalized,
        please send them to us along with the I-140 filing fee.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>5. Drafting the Petition Letter</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        After receiving your complete documentation, we will carefully evaluate
        your credentials and prepare a petition letter with strong legal
        arguments based on our proven strategies. You will receive a draft
        within approximately two weeks for review and feedback. We will revise
        the petition letter until you are fully satisfied.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>6. Preparing Form I-140 and Submitting the Petition</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        We will complete Form I-140, prepare the exhibit list, and organize all
        supporting documents according to USCIS requirements. The completed
        package, including the petition letter, will be sent to you for review
        and signature. After a final check, we will submit the petition package
        to USCIS via FedEx.

        <br />
        After submitting your package, we will scan and email you a copy of the
        USCIS official receipt once available, usually within 2 weeks. Using the
        case number, you can track your case status online on the USCIS website.
        At the same time, we will also monitor your case progress on your
        behalf.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>2. Approval</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        As soon as we receive the approval notice from USCIS, we will notify you
        immediately. The original approval notice will be mailed to you
        promptly. Once approved, your case is considered closed. At this stage,
        we will also email you instructions for filing Form I-485 or assist you
        with preparing the I-485 at a discounted legal fee.

        <strong>3. Request for Evidence (RFE)</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        If USCIS issues an RFE, we will inform you right away and provide
        guidance on preparing additional documents in response. We will draft
        reference letters and legal arguments to address the RFE and submit the
        response on your behalf at no extra cost. If your case is approved after
        responding to the RFE, the process will continue as outlined in the
        approval step above.
        <br />

        <strong>4. In the Rare Case of Denial</strong>

        <br />
        <ol>
          <li>
            <span>Officer’s discretion</span>: Despite our dedicated
            representation, final approval of the I-140 rests with the
            adjudicating officer, and occasional erroneous denials may occur.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Understanding the reasons for denial</span>: If your petition
            is denied, we will notify you immediately, explain the USCIS
            reasoning, and advise you on possible next steps, including an
            appeal.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>Refund or appeal</span>: You may choose to receive a full
            refund right away or proceed with an appeal, which we will handle at
            no additional cost. If the appeal succeeds, the process will follow
            the same steps as an approval.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        We are fully confident in our ability to represent our clients
        successfully. In fact, we are the only U.S. immigration law firm
        offering a refund policy on I-140 petitions. This is not just a
        promise—it is a binding term clearly stated in the attorney-client
        contract .

    Our clients come from diverse backgrounds and regions around the world, and
    petitioning under the National Interest Waiver (NIW) category can offer many
    advantages depending on an individual’s nationality, occupation, and
    research. These advantages generally fall into three groups:
    <br />
    a) general benefits, <br />
    b) nationality-based benefits, and <br />
    c) occupation or research-specific benefits.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>
      General Benefits of Petitioning Under the National Interest Waiver (NIW)
    </strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    Each case is unique and requires a careful legal evaluation, but overall,
    the NIW provides professionals with advanced degrees a pathway that is often
    less demanding than the EB-1A category. For example, a researcher with fewer
    than 100 citations may find it easier to obtain NIW approval compared to
    EB-1A. Additionally, unlike many lower-preference categories, immigrant
    visas under EB-2 are currently available for most countries, allowing many
    applicants to proceed with adjustment of status or consular processing
    without delay. Even for applicants from countries facing EB-2 visa backlogs,
    an NIW can still offer advantages, especially when combined with certain
    valid non-immigrant statuses.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>
      Regional Benefits of Petitioning Under the National Interest Waiver (NIW)
    </strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    Based on our extensive experience, we have identified specific advantages of
    filing an NIW for clients from certain regions and nationalities.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>
      <span>China</span>
    </strong>
    <strong>Benefits of NIW Approval for Individuals Born in China</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    Since EB-2 visas are currently unavailable for individuals born in China,
    applicants must wait for permanent residency even after I-140 approval.
    However, filing for an NIW can be highly beneficial, especially for those
    without a strong EB-1A case but who maintain valid non-immigrant status.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Benefits of NIW Approval for H-1B Holders from China</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    Many Chinese clients maintain lawful presence in the U.S. through the H-1B
    program. Filing for NIW allows them to secure I-140 approval and wait for an
    immigrant visa while continuing employment. Since H-1B permits immigrant
    intent, applicants can travel internationally and extend their status beyond
    the standard six years. An approved I-140 enables H-1B extensions in
    three-year increments until a green card becomes available. Additionally,
    H-4 dependents of these applicants may qualify for Employment Authorization
    Documents (EADs). In short, NIW approval offers both legal stability and
    family work authorization benefits.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>
      Benefits of NIW Approval for F-1 (OPT/STEM) Holders from China
    </strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    Students and graduates on F-1 status, including OPT and STEM extensions, can
    also benefit from NIW approval. Although EB-2 retrogression for Chinese
    applicants is typically 3–5 years, F-1/OPT/STEM status often allows
    sufficient time to remain lawfully in the U.S. while waiting. With proper
    filing strategy and timing, NIW can provide a bridge toward permanent
    residency. However, since the F-1 visa does not permit dual intent,
    applicants should consult with an attorney before filing I-140, as doing so
    could complicate international travel and status renewals.
    <br />
    <br />
    Overall, NIW approval offers significant long-term benefits for Chinese
    nationals, even if immediate permanent residency is not possible.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>
      <span>India</span>
      <br />
      <br />
    </strong>
    <strong>Benefits of NIW Approval for Individuals Born in India</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    Like applicants from China, Indian-born individuals face EB-2 visa
    retrogression, with even longer backlogs. Still, filing for NIW remains
    beneficial, especially for those who may not qualify under EB-1A but
    maintain valid non-immigrant status. H-1B holders from India, in particular,
    gain significant advantages, including extended lawful presence and
    employment authorization for their dependents. With an approved I-140, they
    can extend H-1B status in three-year increments until a visa becomes
    available. This ensures both continuity of employment and family stability
    while awaiting permanent residency.
    <br />
    <br />
    Thus, despite long visa wait times, NIW approval provides Indian nationals
    with a secure path to remain in the U.S. lawfully.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Benefits of NIW Approval for Individuals Born in Iran</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    A large portion of our NIW clients are from Iran, many of whom are in STEM
    fields, and their petitions enjoy a high approval rate. Unlike applicants
    from India and China, Iranians benefit from EB-2 visas currently being
    available. This means they can proceed directly to adjustment of status or
    immigrant visa processing after I-140 approval without long delays. Combined
    with a generally lower evidentiary threshold, NIW offers an excellent option
    for Iranian applicants, even early in their careers.
    <br />
    <br />
    We have also successfully represented Iranian clients applying from abroad,
    including Canada, Europe, and Iran itself, based on their professional
    achievements and research contributions.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>
      <span>Taiwan, Vietnam, South Korea, Nepal, Pakistan, and Others</span>
    </strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    Like Iranian applicants, individuals from these countries benefit greatly
    from NIW approval, as EB-2 visas are currently available for most
    nationalities (except India and China). This allows applicants to apply for
    permanent residency without delay, while also requiring a relatively lower
    evidentiary burden compared to other categories.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>
      Benefits for Applicants from <u>Taiwan</u>
    </strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    With EB-2 visas available, Taiwanese nationals with NIW approval can
    immediately apply for green cards. Many of our successful Taiwanese clients
    were in STEM programs, and both F-1/OPT/STEM and H-1B holders have achieved
    high approval rates through our firm. Visa status itself has not been a
    limiting factor as long as applicants meet legal requirements.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>
      Benefits for Applicants from <u>Vietnam</u>
    </strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    Many Vietnamese clients have secured NIW approvals, though some face
    challenges under J-1 visa restrictions requiring a two-year home residency.
    While the J-1 requirement complicates timelines, it does not prevent NIW
    approval. With careful planning, many Vietnamese applicants successfully
    transitioned to green cards through NIW.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>
      Benefits for Applicants from <u>South Korea</u>
    </strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    We have a strong record of NIW approvals for South Korean nationals,
    including those applying from abroad. Many were employed by internationally
    recognized companies such as Samsung. Their professional achievements and
    expertise enabled us to secure approvals even without a U.S. job offer.

    title: "What does NIW stand for?",
    content: (
      <>
        <p>
          <strong>NIW</strong> stands for{" "}
          <strong>National Interest Waiver</strong>, which is a subcategory of
          the
          <strong> EB-2 employment-based green card</strong> process. Normally,
          the EB-2 category requires a<strong>job offer</strong> and an
          employer-obtained <strong> labor certification (PERM)</strong>. The
          labor certification ensures that no qualified U.S. workers are
          available for the position, protecting the domestic workforce.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the <strong>National Interest Waiver (NIW)</strong>, however,
          applicants can request that the job offer and labor certification
          requirement be <strong>waived</strong>. To qualify, they must
          demonstrate that granting them permanent residency would serve the{" "}
          <strong>national interest</strong> of the United States. This makes it
          possible for individuals to self-petition without employer
          sponsorship.
        </p>
        <p>
          The legal foundation for NIW petitions was established in the
          precedent decision
          <em>Matter of Dhanasar</em> (2016) and was further clarified in the
          January 2025 USCIS policy update, which outlines how officers evaluate
          proposed endeavors, applicants' qualifications, and national interest
          factors
        </p>

  {
    title: "Is NIW a green card?",
    content: (
      <>
        <p>
          The <strong>EB-2 NIW (National Interest Waiver)</strong> is not a
          green card by itself, but rather a<strong> pathway</strong> within the
          U.S. green card process. It allows individuals to
          <strong>self-petition</strong> under the{" "}
          <strong>EB-2 employment-based second preference</strong> category.
          When your <strong>Form I-140</strong> for NIW is approved, it
          establishes your <strong>eligibility </strong>
          for a green card under the EB-2 category. However, I-140 approval is{" "}
          <strong>only the first step</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          To actually obtain <strong>lawful permanent residency</strong> (i.e.,
          your green card), you must complete the second stage of the process:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Adjustment of Status (Form I-485)</strong> if applying from
            within the United States; or
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Consular Processing</strong> at a U.S. embassy or consulate
            if applying from abroad.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This stage depends on <strong>visa availability</strong>, which is
          determined by the monthly
          <strong> Visa Bulletin</strong> published by the U.S. Department of
          State. As of 2025, the EB-2 category is retrogressed across all
          countries. For applicants born outside India and China, the typical
          wait is around <strong>1–2 years</strong>. For applicants from{" "}
          <strong>China</strong>, the wait is generally
          <strong> 4–5 years</strong>, while for <strong>India</strong>, the
          backlog is considerably longer. These timelines may change based on
          visa supply and demand, but retrogression continues to be an important
          factor in green card planning.

    title:
      "What are the differences between Regular EB2 visa and EB2 NIW (National Interest Waiver) petitions?",
    content: (
      <>
        <p>
          In a traditional <strong>EB2 petition</strong>, a{" "}
          <strong>U.S. employer</strong> serves as the{" "}
          <strong>petitioner</strong>. The employer must complete the{" "}
          <strong>labor certification (PERM)</strong> process with the U.S.
          Department of Labor to prove that no minimally qualified U.S. worker
          is available for the position. Once PERM is approved, the employer
          files <strong>Form I-140</strong> on behalf of the foreign national
          (the <strong>beneficiary</strong>).
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast, under the <strong>EB2 NIW</strong>, the foreign national
          can <strong>self-petition</strong>. This means:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            No <strong>job offer</strong> or{" "}
            <strong>labor certification</strong> is required.
          </li>
          <li>
            The petitioner must first meet standard{" "}
            <strong>EB2 eligibility criteria</strong> (advanced degree or
            exceptional ability), and also demonstrate that waiving the job
            offer and labor certification is in the{" "}
            <strong>national interest</strong> of the United States.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          USCIS evaluates NIW petitions using the{" "}
          <strong>three-prong test</strong> from the{" "}
          <strong>
            <em>Matter of Dhanasar</em> (2016)
          </strong>{" "}
          precedent:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The proposed endeavor has <strong>substantial merit</strong> and{" "}
            <strong>national importance</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            The applicant is <strong>well positioned</strong> to advance the
            proposed endeavor.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>On balance</strong>, it would benefit the U.S. to waive the
            job offer and labor certification requirements.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Because of this additional standard,{" "}
          <strong>EB2 NIW petitions</strong> are generally more challenging than
          regular EB2 filings. However, at{" "}
          <strong>North America Immigration Law Group</strong>, we have
          successfully guided over
          <strong>40,000 clients</strong> to EB2 NIW approval. For cases covered
          by our Approval or Refund<sup>®</sup>
          service, our approval rate has stayed
          <strong>above 99%</strong> for the past 10 consecutive years.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <strong>January 2025 USCIS policy update</strong> further
          underscores the need to
          <strong>define the endeavor with specificity</strong> and align it
          with <strong>U.S. national priorities</strong>.

        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Labor Certification (PERM)</strong>: Normally, an employer
            must test the U.S. labor market to confirm no qualified U.S. worker
            is available. This step is{" "}
            <strong>time-consuming and uncertain</strong>. NIW waives it
            entirely.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Job Offer Requirement</strong>: Regular EB2 petitions
            require a full-time, permanent job offer from a U.S. employer. NIW
            allows applicants to qualify based on their own{" "}
            <strong>credentials</strong> and <strong>proposed endeavor</strong>,
            even if self-employed, engaged in independent research, or launching

        <p>
          This waiver is granted only if the petitioner convincingly

          Applicants who do not meet the advanced degree standard may qualify by
          showing <strong>exceptional ability</strong> in their field. This
          requires evidence meeting at least <strong>three</strong> of the

          <li>Letters verifying at least 10 years of full-time experience</li>
          <li>License or certification for the profession</li>
          <li>Evidence of high salary or other significant remuneration</li>
          <li>Membership in professional associations</li>

          A <strong>foreign medical degree</strong> may be considered equivalent

          requirements. According to 2025 policy guidance, applicants must

        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The medical school required a <strong>bachelor’s degree</strong> (or

          </li>
          <li>
            A <strong>credential evaluation</strong> from a recognized agency
            shows equivalency to a U.S. M.D. in terms of coursework, program
            length, and clinical training.
          </li>
          <li>
            Optionally, passing the <strong>USMLE</strong> (Steps 1–3) or the

          USCIS evaluates each case individually. Supporting documentation may
          include <strong>credential evaluations</strong>,
          <strong>exam score reports</strong>, and evidence of the medical
          school’s structure and rigor. Applicants seeking{" "}

          and recognition may suffice.

          in <strong>rigor, content, and outcomes</strong> to a U.S. M.D. Expert
          opinion letters and national-level recognition may also strengthen the

        <p>
          <strong>A. Substantial Merit</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The petitioner must show that the proposed endeavor carries{" "}
          <strong>substantial merit</strong>. As clarified in the January 2025
          USCIS policy update, this means the endeavor should aim to{" "}
          <strong>solve a meaningful problem</strong>,{" "}
          <strong>advance knowledge</strong>, or{" "}
          <strong>improve societal well-being</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>Fields where substantial merit may apply include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Science and technology</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Healthcare and public health</strong>

          <li>
            <strong>Education</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Entrepreneurship and business</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Public policy and the arts</strong>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The work does not need to create{" "}
          <strong>immediate economic benefits</strong>, but it must demonstrate
          a <strong>clear contribution</strong> to its field or society.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Examples of persuasive evidence include:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A <strong>detailed endeavor description</strong> outlining its
            goals, scope, and relevance;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Research papers</strong>, white papers, or other
            documentation showing its significance;
          </li>
          <li>

          <strong>B. National Importance</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The national importance requirement focuses on whether the endeavor’s
          impact extends beyond the individual or local level. According to
          USCIS’s 2025 clarification, officers will consider whether the
          endeavor:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Has <strong>national or international impact</strong> within its
            field;
          </li>
          <li>
            Supports <strong>U.S. government initiatives</strong> or addresses
            recognized public challenges;
          </li>
          <li>
            Promotes <strong>economic growth</strong>,{" "}
            <strong>public health</strong>, <strong>climate resilience</strong>,{" "}
            <strong>technological progress</strong>, or other major goals.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Evidence may include:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A comprehensive <strong>proposed endeavor statement</strong>{" "}
            explaining how the work aligns with national priorities;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Government grants or funding</strong> (e.g., NIH, NSF, DOE,
            DoD) showing formal support;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Letters of endorsement</strong> from U.S. agencies or
            officials;
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Citations, media coverage</strong>, or recognition in
            national strategies or reports.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Together, the evidence should show that the endeavor is both{" "}
          <strong>valuable in its field</strong> and has{" "}
          <strong>broad national significance</strong>. USCIS places emphasis on
          measurable{" "}

        <p>
          Under the third prong of Dhanasar, USCIS applies a{" "}
          <strong>balancing test</strong> to determine whether the{" "}
          <strong>
            foreign national’s contributions outweigh the benefits of labor
            market protections
          </strong>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          As outlined in <strong>2025 USCIS guidance</strong>, adjudicators
          consider:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If the applicant has <strong>specialized expertise</strong> that
            makes labor certification impractical;

          <li>
            If the work <strong>generates jobs</strong>,{" "}

            <strong>strengthens U.S. competitiveness</strong>;
          </li>
          <li>
            If the petition <strong>explains clearly</strong> why bypassing
            labor certification better serves the public interest.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The case must be presented as a <strong>cohesive package</strong>,
          where all documentation and support letters collectively demonstrate
          that labor certification would <strong>delay or hinder</strong>{" "}

          <strong>Publications &amp; Citations:</strong> A complete list of

          more weight than raw numbers.

          the applicant’s specific role.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Memberships:</strong> Selective memberships that require{" "}

        <p>
          <strong>Awards:</strong> Competitive, widely recognized{" "}

          <strong>External Reliance:</strong> Evidence of other institutions or

    <strong>National Interest Waiver (NIW) for Entrepreneurs</strong> <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      Thanks to recent updates in the <b>USCIS Policy Manual</b>, entrepreneurs
      now have a clearer pathway to secure a green card through the National
      Interest Waiver (NIW). Unlike traditional immigration routes requiring
      employer sponsorship, the NIW empowers entrepreneurs to self-petition if
      they can demonstrate that their work significantly benefits the United
      States. This page explains how founders and innovators can use the NIW to
      establish and grow businesses in the U.S. while driving economic growth,
      innovation, and societal impact.
    </p>
    <br />
    <strong>What is the NIW for Entrepreneurs?</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      The National Interest Waiver allows qualified individuals to bypass labor
      certification and employer sponsorship if their endeavor holds substantial
      merit and national importance. While historically associated with
      researchers and academics, recent policy updates emphasize its relevance
      to entrepreneurs. To qualify, applicants must show that their venture
      benefits the U.S. and that they are well-positioned to advance it
      successfully.

          EB1-A (Alien of Extraordinary Ability) , also known as EB1-EA, is a
          subgroup of the first-preference employment-based immigration (EB-1).
          At <b>North America Immigration Law Group</b>, we specialize in EB1-A
          petitions for individuals with extraordinary ability in science, arts,
          education, business, or athletics. Unlike EB1-B, EB1-C, and other
          employment-based categories, EB1-A does not require a job offer or
          employer sponsorship. Applicants must demonstrate they will continue
          working in their field of expertise and that their contributions will
          substantially benefit the U.S. The most challenging requirement is
          proving sustained national or international acclaim. With extensive
          experience, our firm has developed winning strategies to build strong
          EB1-A cases through comprehensive documentation and persuasive legal
          argumentation.

        <p>
          EB1-A offers significant advantages. Most importantly, applicants can{" "}
          self-petition without a U.S. employer, provided they will continue
          working in their area of extraordinary ability. While self-petition is
          possible, we strongly recommend professional legal assistance due to
          the complex regulations involved. Our attorneys have successfully
          handled thousands of EB1-A petitions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another benefit is that no labor certification is required. Since
          labor certification is a lengthy process, EB1-A saves applicants
          considerable time, making it one of the fastest routes to a green card
          for qualified individuals.

          USCIS defines “extraordinary ability” as being among the top few
          percent in one’s field, demonstrated through sustained acclaim and
          recognition. Evidence may include major international awards (e.g.,
          Nobel Prize, Academy Award) or at least three of the following:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards</li>
          <li>Membership in associations requiring outstanding achievement</li>
          <li>
            Published material about the individual in major journals or media
          </li>
          <li>Judging the work of peers in the field</li>
          <li>Original contributions of major significance</li>
          <li>Authorship of scholarly articles</li>
          <li>Exhibition of work at major venues</li>
          <li>Leading or critical role in distinguished organizations</li>
          <li>High salary compared to others in the field</li>

          USCIS requires that the applicant belongs to the small percentage at
          the top of their field. Defining the field of endeavor is crucial—too
          broad makes it difficult to stand out, while too narrow may appear
          artificial. Our attorneys help clients strategically define their

          Strong EB1-A petitions emphasize comparison. For instance, in academic

          appears in top-tier journals or has been extensively cited
          distinguishes them from peers. Our attorneys structure evidence to

    </strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    <ol>
      <li>
        <span>Unlimited consultations during representation</span>: Once we
        receive your signed agreement and payment, we provide full legal support
        until your case is closed. This includes:
        <ul>
          <li>Keeping you updated on all case developments</li>
          <li>Answering all your questions promptly</li>
          <li>Returning phone calls without delay</li>

      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Identifying recommenders</span>: We work with you to select the
        most suitable recommenders for your case. While USCIS doesn’t set a
        fixed number, typically 3–7 letters are recommended.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <span>Drafting recommendation letters</span>: Unlike many firms that
        only provide templates or charge extra, we draft tailored letters for
        you. Since strong letters are vital for success, you will provide us
        with details about your recommenders, their reputation, and how their
        expertise relates to your work.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <span>Preparing the petition letter</span>: After gathering your signed
        recommendation letters, we create a legal summary and arguments aligned
        with our proven strategy. You’ll receive a draft within a week for
        review and revision until you’re fully satisfied.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <span>Form I-140 preparation and filing</span>: We prepare Form I-140,
        compile evidence, and organize documentation per USCIS standards. You
        will review and sign before we finalize and submit via FedEx.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <span>Responding to RFE</span>: If USCIS requests further evidence, we
        promptly draft legal arguments and additional letters at no extra cost.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <span>In case of denial</span>: If denied, you may choose between a full
        refund or a free appeal. This ensures that you are never left
        unprotected.

        <br />

        <p>
          Our principal attorney will personally review your information, assess
          your qualifications, and provide an honest evaluation of your chances
          of success. At North America Immigration Law Group, we use a{" "}

          framework and the attorney’s expertise.
        </p>
        <br />

        <strong>3. Possible Outcomes of Your Evaluation</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>A. You Qualify for EB1-A (Alien of Extraordinary Ability):</p>
        <p>
          If, after thorough review, you meet the criteria for EB1-A, you may
          proceed with our guaranteed service package: you pay 50% upon signing
          the Retainer Agreement, and in the event of denial, you receive a full
          refund.
        </p>

        <p>B. You Do Not Qualify for EB1-A:</p>
        <p>
          If your profile does not meet the EB1-A threshold, we will explore
          alternative immigration options with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other possible categories include EB1-B for Outstanding Professors and

        <strong>4. Continued Communication</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          Once you receive your evaluation, you are welcome to reach out via
          phone or email to discuss your case, ask questions, or share concerns.
          Having specific questions often helps clarify your priorities. Please
          note that all information shared with us remains strictly
          confidential.

        <br />

        <strong>5. Your Decision</strong>
        <br />
        <br />

        <br />
        <p>
          Up to this stage, the evaluation of your eligibility and the exchange

            and phone scripts to assist you. Since many recommenders are busy

            prefer to receive drafts (which is common), we will prepare them
            based on the information you provide. Since you know your
            recommenders best—their authority, expertise, and how your work
            relates to theirs—you will need to provide us with detailed
            information about their background and connection to your research.

            initial drafts and send them to you for feedback. After revisions
            are completed, you will forward the finalized versions to your
            recommenders for review, approval, and signature. Additional
            revisions may be made if recommenders request changes.

          Along with recommendation letters, you will need to gather and prepare

          <li>
            Evidence of your participation as a judge of others’ work (e.g.,

          <li>
            Documentation of your significant contributions to the field (e.g.,

          our proven petition framework and prepare a legal summary with strong
          arguments. You will receive the first draft of the petition letter

          You will receive the prepared Form for review and signature, along

          After submitting your petition package, we will scan and email you a
          copy of the USCIS official receipt once it becomes available, usually
          within about 2 weeks. Using this receipt number, you can track your

          When USCIS issues an approval notice, we will inform you immediately
          and promptly mail the original notice to you. At this point, your case
          is considered successfully completed. We will also provide you with
          guidance on filing Form I-485 or, if you prefer, prepare your I-485

        <p>
          If USCIS issues an RFE, we will notify you right away and guide you in
          gathering the additional documents required. We will prepare response
          letters, including legal arguments and supporting evidence, at{" "}
          <strong>no additional charge</strong>. If your case is approved
          following the RFE response, the process will proceed as described in

            <span>Adjudicating officer’s discretion</span>: Despite thorough

            the appeal results in an approval, your case will proceed as
            outlined in the approval section.

        labor certification. Additionally, EB-1A visas are always current,
        meaning applicants do not have to wait for a priority date to become
        available to obtain a Green Card once their case is approved. Another
        advantage is that no job offer is required.

        <p>
          In 2010, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (Kazarian case) outlined a
          two-part analysis for EB-1A petitions:
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Step 1:</b> Determine if the applicant has submitted evidence
          meeting the required criteria (e.g., a major award like a Nobel Prize
          or at least three of the ten listed evidentiary criteria). At this
          stage, the adjudicator only checks if evidence exists—not its quality.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Step 2:</b> Evaluate the totality of the evidence to determine if
          the applicant truly qualifies as being at the top of their field.
          Here, the quality and significance of the evidence are reviewed. For
          instance, external judging responsibilities carry more weight than
          internal ones, and citation counts may indicate the impact of
          scholarly work.

      <>
        A recommendation letter, also called a reference letter, is written by
        an expert in the petitioner’s field (or a related area). These letters
        are crucial in employment-based immigration petitions since USCIS
        officers may not be experts in the applicant’s field. Strong
        recommendation letters provide essential evidence of extraordinary
        ability. <br /> Answer provided by North America Immigration Law Group.

        Letters from independent experts outside your immediate circle carry the
        most weight, as they show recognition of your contributions beyond
        personal or professional connections. While letters from close
        colleagues may help, USCIS gives them less importance unless the
        recommenders are highly distinguished in the field. Ideally,
        recommenders should both be experts and familiar with your specific
        work, allowing them to give detailed and credible support. <br /> Answer

    content: (
      <>
        {" "}
        <p>
          The eligibility criteria and preparation process for National Interest
          Waiver (NIW) petitions and EB-1A (Alien of Extraordinary Ability)
          petitions are quite different. NIW petitions do not require the
          applicant to prove that they are at the absolute top of their field,
          but rather that their work carries substantial merit and national
          importance to the United States. On the other hand, EB-1A petitions
          focus more heavily on demonstrating that the foreign national has
          achieved sustained national or international acclaim and belongs to
          the very small percentage who have risen to the very top of their
          field. In both cases, presenting strong documentation that frames the
          beneficiary’s achievements in the most favorable light is essential.
          For example, carefully defining and narrowing the petitioner’s field
          of expertise allows USCIS to compare the beneficiary against a
          smaller, more relevant group of peers in the U.S., while still
          maintaining credibility. The field, however, should not be so narrowly
          defined that it appears artificial or lacks documentary support. Once
          an I-140 is approved, both NIW and EB-1A classifications are treated
          similarly at the adjustment of status (I-485) stage. Importantly, it
          is legally permissible to file both petitions simultaneously, and many
          applicants do so in order to increase their chances of success. Filing
          multiple I-140 petitions under different categories is allowed, and in
          fact, it often improves the likelihood of at least one approval.{" "}

        {" "}
        <p>
          Yes. There is no strict requirement that applicants must have
          published journal articles to qualify for or obtain approval of an
          EB-1A petition. While publications are valuable because they help
          demonstrate original contributions and authorship, you can still
          establish eligibility by meeting other criteria set forth under EB-1A
          regulations. For instance, evidence such as awards, patents,
          significant citations, original scientific or business contributions,
          memberships in professional associations, or judging the work of
          others can support your case. Furthermore, EB-1A is a self-petition
          category, meaning you do not need sponsorship from your current
          employer to file. You may independently petition on your own behalf.{" "}

        <p>
          Yes. While awards can strengthen an EB-1A petition by helping to
          satisfy one of the recognized regulatory criteria, they are not an
          absolute requirement. Many successful EB-1A cases have been approved
          without awards. Instead, you may rely on other evidence that
          demonstrates your extraordinary ability and sustained recognition.
          Examples include original contributions of major significance,
          authorship of scholarly articles, service as a judge of others’ work,
          holding critical roles in distinguished organizations, or comparable
          evidence showing that you are among the small percentage who has risen
          to the top of your field. As long as sufficient documentation is
          presented to satisfy the EB-1A criteria, the lack of awards will not
          automatically disqualify your petition. <br />

          Yes. You may apply for EB-1A now even if you are subject to the J-1

          I-140 petition, you cannot adjust your status to permanent residency

          residency requirement. Importantly, you do not need to have a J-1
          waiver in place before submitting an I-140 petition. The law only
          prevents you from adjusting status directly from J-1 to permanent
          residency without first resolving the two-year requirement. Many
          applicants prepare and file the I-140 petition and J-1 waiver
          concurrently. If your I-140 is approved before the waiver, you must

    <strong>Introduction</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    The EB1-B category, a sub-classification of priority workers , is designed
    for professors and researchers who can demonstrate that they are recognized
    internationally for exceptional achievements within their academic
    discipline. To qualify, the petition must provide strong evidence of such
    recognition and confirm that the applicant has accumulated at least three
    years of verifiable teaching or research experience in the field. While a
    labor certification is not required, the applicant must secure an ongoing
    job offer from a sponsoring U.S. employer. In the case of universities and
    colleges, the role should generally be a tenured or tenure-track position.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Self-Petition Not Permitted</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    Unlike the EB1-A category, individuals cannot self-petition for EB1-B. A
    U.S. employer must submit the petition to USCIS as the official petitioner,
    while the foreign national serves as the beneficiary.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>EB1-B Eligibility Requirements</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    To be classified as an outstanding professor or researcher, the applicant
    must satisfy all of the following:
    <br />
    <br />
    <ol>
      <li>
        Be recognized internationally as an outstanding contributor in a
        specific academic field,
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Have a minimum of three years of teaching or research experience in that
        field, and
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Possess a qualifying job offer, such as:
        <br />
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>(a) A tenured or tenure-track teaching position, OR</li>
          <li>
            (b) A research position with no fixed term and an expectation of
            long-term employment, OR
          </li>
          <li>
            (c) A comparable research role with a private employer that employs
            at least three full-time researchers and has documented achievements
            in the relevant field.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    <strong>Demonstrating International Recognition</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    The petition must prove that the foreign national is regarded
    internationally as outstanding in their area of expertise. USCIS allows
    expert recommendation letters as supporting evidence, provided they
    specifically discuss the applicant’s original, significant, and influential
    contributions to the field. Click here to read &nbsp;

    </a>
    .
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Calculating “Three Years” of Experience</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    Applicants must document at least three years of teaching or research
    experience in the relevant academic field. Experience gained during advanced
    degree studies may only be counted if the degree has been awarded, and the
    teaching involved full responsibility for a class or if the research has
    been recognized within the academic community as noteworthy.
    <br />
    <br />
    Proof must come in the form of letters from past or current employers,
    specifying the name, title, and contact information of the author, along
    with a detailed description of the applicant’s responsibilities and
    contributions.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Tenure, Tenure-Track, or Comparable Positions</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    An EB1-B petition requires that the applicant be offered a qualifying
    academic or research position. For universities, this means a tenured or
    tenure-track appointment. In private organizations, the role must be
    comparable in scope and responsibility, provided the employer has the
    required number of full-time researchers and an established record of
    research accomplishments.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Permanent Research Positions</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    Since not all university research positions are tenure-track, USCIS accepts
    offers for “permanent research positions.” A permanent position refers to
    one with an indefinite duration and an expectation of continued employment,
    subject only to valid grounds for termination.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Comparable Roles with Private Employers</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    Because private employers rarely use tenure systems, USCIS considers a
    position “comparable” if the duties align with those of a researcher in an
    academic institution and if the role is permanent in nature as defined by
    USCIS rules.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Definition of a Qualified Employer</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    For EB1-B purposes, not all employers are eligible. Government agencies at
    the federal, state, or local level generally do not qualify, unless the
    agency is also a U.S. university or institution of higher education.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>The Standard of Being “Outstanding”</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    To establish eligibility as an outstanding professor or researcher, the
    petitioner must provide evidence meeting at least two of the following six
    criteria:
    <br />
    <br />
    <ol>
      <li>
        Proof of receiving major prizes or awards for achievements in the
        academic field,
      </li>
      <li>
        Membership in associations that require outstanding achievements as a
        condition of entry,
      </li>
      <li>
        Published material in professional publications about the applicant’s
        work, including translated sources, with author, title, and publication
        details,
      </li>
      <li>
        Participation as a judge, individually or on a panel, evaluating the
        work of others in the same or related academic field,
      </li>
      <li>
        Evidence of original scientific or scholarly contributions of major
        significance,
      </li>
      <li>
        Authorship of scholarly books or peer-reviewed journal articles with
        international circulation.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    <strong>USCIS Review Standard</strong>
    <br />
    <br />
    Similar to EB1-A petitions, EB1-B petitions are reviewed under the
    <a href="https://www.wegreened.com/EB1A_twopart" class="link_underline">
      two-part analysis
    </a>
    framework. USCIS evaluates the evidence as a whole, weighing the quality,
    significance, and relevance of the documentation. Simply meeting two
    criteria does not guarantee approval; adjudicators assess whether the
    overall record demonstrates that the applicant is truly recognized as
    outstanding in their field. If USCIS finds the evidence insufficient, they
    may request additional documentation.
    <br />
    <br />
    According to a June 1992 INS memorandum, the following evidence tends to
    strengthen a case significantly:
    <br />
    <br />
    <ol>
      <li>Peer-reviewed conference or symposium presentations,</li>
      <li>Peer-reviewed articles in established scholarly journals,</li>
      <li>
        Testimonies from other scholars highlighting the applicant’s
        contributions,
      </li>
      <li>
        Frequent citations of the applicant’s work in academic citation indexes,
      </li>
      <li>Service as a reviewer for peer-reviewed scholarly journals.</li>

          The responsibility to prove eligibility lies entirely with the

          out of the six regulatory criteria. If the foreign professor or
          researcher is qualified, success depends heavily on how the case is
          documented and presented. Well-prepared evidence and persuasive
          arguments usually result in approval. Historically, EB1-B cases have
          had a high approval rate—over 90% in the past five years. See{" "}

          Yes. Since many research positions at universities are not formally
          classified as tenured or tenure-track, USCIS allows a “permanent
          research position” to qualify. A permanent position is one that is of
          indefinite or unlimited duration, where continued employment is

          Because private employers generally do not grant tenure, USCIS
          considers a “comparable” position acceptable if the duties and
          responsibilities closely align with those of an academic researcher.
          Specifically, the position must be permanent, as defined by USCIS

        <p>
          A letter of recommendation, also called a reference letter, is written
          by an expert in the applicant’s field or by an authoritative figure in
          a related discipline. These letters are crucial because USCIS officers
          are rarely subject-matter experts. Recommendation letters help
          demonstrate that the applicant meets the “outstanding” standard
          required by law, serving as strong objective evidence to support the
          petition.

    title: "Whom should I contact to obtain letters of recommendation?",

        <p>
          USCIS expects that a person with genuine international recognition
          should be able to provide sufficient independent evidence reflecting
          that recognition. Therefore, recommendation letters from independent
          experts and individuals outside of your immediate circle carry greater
          credibility, as they demonstrate acknowledgment of your work from the
          broader community. If your contributions are not widely recognized
          beyond your current or former colleagues, it will be difficult to
          establish that you have attained sustained international recognition.
          For this reason, recommendation letters from only close colleagues are
          less persuasive in proving your case.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ideally, the recommender should be both an expert in your field and
          sufficiently familiar with your work to describe your research and
          contributions in detail. While letters from highly reputed experts are
          valuable, the strongest letters come from experts who can specifically
          discuss your accomplishments. A letter from your current or
          prospective employer can also serve as an appropriate recommendation.

            the applicant’s work. If the recommender comments on the applicant’s
            achievements, their own qualifications should be clearly

            <b>Expert testimonials:</b> Endorsements from experts are essential
            to demonstrate that the applicant meets the legal standard of
            international recognition. However, letters that only show basic
            competence or fail to distinguish the applicant from others in the
            field hold little value and may even weaken the case.

            contributions. Employer or professor letters should clearly outline
            the applicant’s responsibilities and the significance of their work.

          EB1-B and NIW petitions are distinct categories with different

          sponsor, while NIW applicants can self-petition. However, once the

          categories when it comes to filing the I-485 for adjustment of status.

        <p>
          It is permissible to file multiple petitions simultaneously—for
          example, both EB1-B and NIW. Some applicants do this to maximize their
          chances, as the law does not prohibit filing under multiple categories

        <p>
          EB1-A (Extraordinary Ability) allows self-petition, while EB1-B
          (Outstanding Professors and Researchers) requires a job offer from a
          U.S. employer. Thus, EB1-B applicants cannot self-sponsor.

          While EB1-A has a higher evidentiary standard—requiring proof of a

          can be somewhat easier to qualify for.

    <strong>
       Introduction
    </strong>
    <p>
      Foreign nationals who receive an offer of permanent employment in the
      United States must demonstrate eligibility to file an employment-based
      preference petition. This can be established in one of three ways:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        By obtaining labor certification (required for employment-based second
        and third preference categories),
      </li>
      <li>
        By qualifying for an exemption from labor certification (available under
        the first, fourth, and fifth employment-based preference categories), or
      </li>
      <li>By qualifying under a Schedule A category.</li>
    </ol>
    <strong>Labor Certification</strong>
    <p>
      Foreign individuals who have been offered permanent employment in the
      U.S., but who do not qualify for an exemption from labor certification,
      must secure an Alien Employment Certification—commonly known as labor
      certification—from the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). The DOL must be
      convinced that there are no available, qualified U.S. workers to fill the
      offered position and that the wages and working conditions will not
      negatively affect the domestic labor market. Once granted, the labor
      certification becomes the foundation for filing an employment-based second
      or third preference petition with USCIS.
    </p>
    <strong>
       Standards DOL (Department of Labor)
      Applies to Exclude Foreign Workers
    </strong>
    <p>
      When issuing certifications, the DOL applies two central standards to
      limit the hiring of foreign workers:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        If qualified, available, and willing U.S. workers exist for the role,
        and/or
      </li>
      <li>
        If employing a foreign national would negatively affect the wages or
        working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      “Lawful U.S. workers” include U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents,
      asylees, and refugees.
    </p>
    <strong>
       Requirements to Obtain Labor
      Certification
    </strong>
    <p>
      To secure labor certification, the employer must prove that a structured
      recruitment program was conducted to test the local labor market for
      qualified and available U.S. workers in the geographic location where the
      position will be based. The employer must demonstrate to the DOL that:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The job being offered to the foreign national is open and available to
        U.S. workers,
      </li>
      <li>
        The job does not impose unreasonable or unnecessary requirements, and
      </li>
      <li>
        The wage being offered meets or exceeds the prevailing wage within the
        community.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <strong>
       Reduction in Recruitment
    </strong>
    <p>
      In specific situations, employers may be able to bypass the labor
      certification process by showing the DOL that, over at least six months,
      they have made genuine, customary efforts to fill the position but have
      been unable to identify qualified U.S. candidates.

        What is the Effect of Reduction in Recruitment during PERM Process?
      </strong>
      <p>
        If an employer has attempted, for a period of at least six months, to
        fill a position through normal and customary recruitment methods without
        success, they may qualify to bypass the standard labor certification
        procedure. In such cases, the DOL may agree that further labor
        certification is unnecessary because the employer has already made
        consistent, good-faith efforts to hire. When these recruitment efforts
        are thoroughly documented, the employer may request permission for a
        Reduction in Recruitment certification. This approach effectively
        acknowledges the employer’s efforts as conclusive proof of the labor
        market test, thereby shortening processing time. Given efficiency and
        budget considerations, this streamlined method is becoming increasingly
        significant for the future.

    <strong>
       Measures to Protect U.S Workers
    </strong>
    <p>
      To safeguard the interests of U.S. workers, the DOL has introduced several
      protective measures: (1) Prohibition on tailoring job requirements; (2) No
      unreasonable conditions; (3) Prevailing wage enforcement; (4) Employers
      cannot favor foreign nationals solely for being more qualified; and (5)
      Additional documentation requirements in the case of recent layoffs.

        DOL Measures to Protect U.S. Workers
      </strong>
      <p>
        The Department of Labor enforces several safeguards to ensure that the
        labor certification process does not disadvantage U.S. workers.
      </p>
      <p style="font-weight: 600;margin-bottom: -10px;">
        A. No Tailoring the Job:
      </p>
      <p>
        The DOL ensures that employers cannot create job requirements
        specifically tailored to match a foreign applicant’s background. Any
        unusual qualifications must be justified as a legitimate business
        necessity, not as a preference for a particular candidate.
      </p>

      <p style="font-weight: 600;margin-bottom: -10px;">
        B. No Unreasonable Conditions:
      </p>
      <p>
        The DOL will deny certification if an employer imposes unreasonable
        conditions that only a foreign national can meet, unless such conditions
        are proven essential to the business. For instance, requiring fluency in
        a specific foreign language is generally considered unreasonable unless
        it is clearly necessary for the job.
      </p>

      <p style="font-weight: 600;margin-bottom: -10px;">
        C. Prevailing Wage Requirement:
      </p>
      <p>
        The employer must offer the position at the prevailing wage determined
        for the job type and location. The DOL assesses the prevailing wage
        through state-level offices. If an employer disputes the determination,
        they may submit alternative evidence, such as an independent wage
        survey, to challenge the DOL’s decision.
      </p>

      <p style="font-weight: 600;margin-bottom: -10px;">
        D. Cannot Prefer Foreign Nationals Simply for Being More Qualified:
      </p>
      <p>
        Employers are not permitted to bypass U.S. workers in favor of foreign
        nationals solely because the latter may appear more qualified. A U.S.
        worker who meets the basic requirements cannot be rejected if they can
        reasonably perform the job duties, even with additional training.
        Employers may only hire foreign nationals when U.S. candidates fail to
        meet the established minimum qualifications, which are determined by the
        DOL and published in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT).
      </p>

      <p style="font-weight: 600;margin-bottom: -10px;">
        E. Extra Documentation for Recent Layoffs:
      </p>
      <p>
        If the employer has conducted layoffs within six months before filing
        for labor certification, they must provide evidence showing that
        laid-off U.S. workers in similar or related occupations were notified
        and considered for the position.
      </p>

      <i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> What is PERM (Program Electronic
      Review Management)?
    </strong>
    <p>
      In 2004, the DOL introduced final regulations establishing the Program
      Electronic Review Management (PERM) system. Implemented on March 28, 2005,
      PERM was designed to accelerate the labor certification process while
      integrating stronger protections for U.S. workers.
    </p>
    <strong>
      <i class="fa fa-calendar"></i> PERM Process
    </strong>
    <p>
      The PERM process requires employers to complete all recruitment activities
      before filing the application, and recruitment must be conducted within
      six months of submission.

        What are the Initial Steps of PERM Filing?
      </strong>
      <p>
        Before submitting a labor certification application under the PERM
        system, employers (or their legal representatives) must complete several
        preliminary steps:
      </p>

      <p style="font-weight: 600;margin-bottom: -10px;">
        A. Online Registration:
      </p>
      <p>
        Employers must register through the PERM online portal. Filing can begin
        only after the registration is successfully approved.
      </p>

      <p style="font-weight: 600;margin-bottom: -10px;">
        B. Filing ETA Form 9089:
      </p>
      <p>
        The official labor certification application is filed using ETA Form
        9089, also known as the Application for Permanent Employment
        Certification. Electronic filing is encouraged. The form requires
        detailed descriptions of the job, including minimum education,
        experience, and any special requirements. The application must be filed
        within 180 days of the earliest recruitment step.
      </p>

      <p style="font-weight: 600;margin-bottom: -10px;">
        C. Supporting Documentation Not Submitted Initially:
      </p>
      <p>
        Employers are not required to submit supporting documentation with the
        application. However, they must retain it in case of a DOL audit.
      </p>
    </div>
    <strong>
      <i class="fa fa-puzzle-piece"></i> Advertisement: 30-day Job Order and
      Newspaper Publication
    </strong>
    <p>
      Once the employer submits the labor certification application, the
      Employment Service verifies that the job was offered at the prevailing
      wage. The job is then posted on the State Workforce Agency (SWA) system
      serving the area of intended employment for 30 days. Concurrently, the
      employer must also advertise the job opening in a newspaper of general
      circulation or an appropriate trade journal.

        Description and Period Requirements of PERM Filing Advertisement
      </strong>
      <p>
        The DOL has established specific requirements for job advertisements
        under the PERM system.
      </p>

      <p style="font-weight: 600;margin-bottom: -10px;">
        A. Advertisement Content:
      </p>
      <p>
        The job posting must clearly state the employer’s name, job location, a
        description sufficient to inform potential applicants of the position,
        and instructions for submitting applications or resumes directly to the
        employer.
      </p>

      <p style="font-weight: 600;margin-bottom: -10px;">
        B. Timing Requirements:
      </p>
      <p>
        At least 30 days must pass between the final day of the job posting or
        advertisement and the submission of the application.
      </p>
    </div>
    <strong>
      <i class="fa fa-puzzle-piece"></i> DOL Initial Processing and Audit
    </strong>
    <p>
      Once submitted, the application is reviewed through the DOL’s automated
      system, which checks key fields against established rules. If the
      application fails to comply, an immediate denial is issued. Applications
      that pass this initial screening may then be flagged for audit based on
      program-specific criteria or random selection. The audit process is
      intended to ensure compliance and detect problematic filings.

      Denials

    <p>
      Some frequent errors that trigger automated denials or lead to rejection
      during final review include:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Submitting an application with an expired prevailing wage determination
        from the SWA,
      </li>
      <li>
        Failing to keep the job order active with the SWA for the required 30
        days,
      </li>
      <li>
        Submitting the application less than 30 days after completing the
        required job posting or recruitment steps, or
      </li>
      <li>
        Listing recruitment activities on Form 9089 that occurred outside the
        180-/30-day timeframe allowed for recruitment.
